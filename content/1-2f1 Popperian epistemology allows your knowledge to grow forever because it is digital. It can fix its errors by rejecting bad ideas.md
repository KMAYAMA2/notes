Popperian epistemology allows your knowledge to grow forever because it is digital, meaning it fixes its errors by rejecting bad ideas. It either keeps or discards (binary). Other epistemologies are analogue and keep both new and old theories by rating them on degrees of truth (or probabilistic truth). They are bounded because they can’t correct errors.
