- In real life you quit but that quitting transfers one way or other to your next adventure because everything is connected ([[2-1d 'Ecosystem' & 'Thermodynamics' & 'Double-entry bookkeeping' - Everything is connected, there is no free lunch]])
	- In contrast, video games without interoperability gives you the impression that success or failure in one area doesn't translate into other areas
		- [[4-1a4b2b1 'One-of-those' over one-off - Learn from history (not just from your 'own' experience)]]

- [[1-1a2f You are redundant if you are flexible and (close to being) universal - that is, composable and interoperable]]
- [[2-1b2g 'Margin of safety' - Be redundant and resourceful]]
- [[5-1b1 Invest in preparedness. Be redundant and resourceful in every aspect. Minimize opportunity cost to achieve great things.]]

- [[2-1b2c 'Compounding' - Permeate across the timeline]]
	- [[2-1b2 Play in different time horizon. That is, in the long-run.]]
