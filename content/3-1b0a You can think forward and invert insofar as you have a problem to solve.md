- Live in the future and build what seems interesting

- Procrastinators often follow exactly the wrong tack. They try to minimize their commitments, assuming that if they have only a few things to do, they will quit procrastinating and get them done. (Link to least energy principle from mental model)

- But this goes contrary to the basic nature of the procrastinator and destroys his most important source of motivation.

- A case for having grandiose project, probably. Because the bigger problem almost necessarily breaks down into mini-problems.
