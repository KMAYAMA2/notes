[[2-1a5 'Sampling' - Increase your sample size with QUALITY data]]

Historic events = chaos = surprises = contingencies = abductions

Throwing randomness here and there can counter a dangerous combination of:
[[2-1a1a6 'Tendency to overgeneralize from small samples']]
[[2-1a6c1 'Tendency to minimize energy output' - Align your incentives properly, then (almost) everything will follow]]
[[2-1a6c1a 'First-conclusion bias' - Separate the problem-defining phase of the decision-making process form the problem-solving phase]]

Put differently:
[[3-1b2 Use the Fun Criterion to filter what problems to work on]]
[[5-1b4c2a When you have an agency, you don't get depleted. We aren't powered by a battery.]]
