- The original source is the following:
***"For memes, ideas in people’s minds are replicators. Meme-based behaviors can be replicators, because we can guess the meaning of memes. For rational memes, knowledge is the replicator."***
*Both societies based on anti-rational and rational memes will manifest varieties in their behaviors because the meaning of anything (knowledge-ideas-behaviors) cannot be uniformly interpreted, for that is the definition and ontology of knowledge (or more precisely, how information exist in the world). The difference is, in the latter society the origin of both variation and selection mechanism is somewhat understood and meme evolution is encouraged, while in the former society it is arbitrarily suppressed. In other words, anti-rational society suppress via the phenotype, while rational society is more about the genotype in the sense that what it cares about is knowledge creation per se, and less about the consequences of those creations.*

- We can interpret behaviors as symbols emanating from some meaning which exists as an idea in people's minds, but they can never be replicated fully for two minds never hold the same problem-situation. Interpretations are sure to vary. Rational society is an attempt to grasp the knowledge at the core from the start. It welcomes the contingency and arbitrariness, in exchange for adhering to the objective reality.

- When you replicate behaviors only: antirational society.
- When you replicate the knowledge: rational society.
