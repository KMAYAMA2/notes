- [[7-1a1b Theoretical physics has that universal applicability because the laws of physics apply to all things physical]]

**Biological knowledge is more analog than explanatory knowledge:**
  - [[1-2f1b2 Composability allows incremental piecemeal error-correction]]
    - [[10-2g2c1 Symbols are universal. Being arbitrary and contingent means it can represent anything, and do everything.]]
      - [[1-2g1c2a ヒトの特殊性は情報処理能力そのものではなく、情報を記号により外部化する能力にある]]
<br>
- Or should be phrased: **Explanatory knowledge ≠ Biological knowledge - Humans are self-aware of how knowledge is created and what knowledge is (because we use symbols => because we have meanings?)**
*Other life-forms can't say "could've been otherwise" because for them everything is non-arbitrary, because they can't use symbols*
- ^ This might be incorrect because:
- [[10-2e9 Variants do exist in the multiverse - not in the past or in the future, but they literally do exist somewhere in the multiverse!]]
- [[1-2g2s7b2 The laws of physics determine what's rare-common, probable-improbable, finite-infinite]]

**Explanatory knowledge creation ≠ Biological knowledge (the former, specifically scientific knowledge, is universal)**
- Because explanatory knowledge is represented by symbols. And symbols are universal. And only humans use symbols.

- [[9-4b2f The most important source of variation in explanatory theories is creativity. More ‘jumps’ via creativity allows qualitatively different types of ‘mutations’.]]
<br>
- Creativity is more than just recombining things. We have the Fun Criterion. We (or our culture) choose ideas-memes, whereas genes choose other life-forms:
- [[3-1c3c1 To create is to recombine. Innovation happens when ideas have sex (either between people or with one’s past ideas). Exchange is to technology as sex is to evolution.]]
- [[AN3C - Recombination is 1,000x more effective than random mutation]]
- [[7-1c1 Intuition about which hill to climb is usually better than people realize]]
- [[9-4b2b The evolution of ideas (memes) is somewhat intentional, whereas that of genes are random AND cannot be rejected]]
- [[10-2g1 Culture is an implicit theory for its members. It dictates what to look at and how they reason about the world.]]
<br>
- Other life-forms create knowledge but they aren't aware of its meanings. Only we can tell that they've been creating knowledge.
- [[10-2g2c2 Human minds are capable of knowing what ideas mean]]
<br>
**Biological knowledge is analog and parochial:**
*“Genes explain how its carriers survived and replicated those genes within its vicinity. Knowledge and its explanatory power can jump to universality such that its applicability is not limited to where that knowledge was created.”*
