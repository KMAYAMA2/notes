- Somewhat crazy connection (listening to someone became more difficult because these days everyone can 'publish' anything):
- [[4-1d3 The most effective communication is to listen]]
- [[8-1c3a Internet turned everyone into publisher. Crypto can turn everyone into investor.]]

- But that what is intrinsic to humans (e.g., recursive thought) remains even with such symbiotic ongoing evolution? Maybe not, considering our universality. That is, our contingency-arbitrary way of existing. #develop
  - [[10-2d2 ‘The tools for thought’ do not necessarily have to accommodate recursiveness, because we can think recursively nonetheless]]
  - [[10-1b9 Ethnogrammatical studies are to explain the linkage between nonlinguistic evidence and noncultural evidence]]
  - [[10-2g2c1 Symbols are universal. Being arbitrary and contingent means it can represent anything, and do everything.]]
<br>
- But humans became self-aware of THAT (brains and symbols evolve reflexively to deal with cultural pressures) and achieved universality
