[[10-2g1f2a Our brains (including our emotions) and our cultures are related symbiotically through the individual, and that neither supervenes on the other]]

[[10-2g1f3 We can only figure out what they know by what they do ('performance'), because we can never directly study what people know ('competence'). To assert that we can is a common error in thinking.]]

**Culture is more powerful than genotype in affecting human phenotype:**
[[1-1b Memes are more powerful than genes because they can out-evolve them]]
[[1-1a Culture and technology can influence our perception of what human mind is — explicitly, inexplicitly, and unconsciously]]
[[7-1d2a The relation between technology and the problem-situation (i.e., culture and mind) is reflexive]]
[[1-2g1c4 Technology is what makes us humans]]
[[6-1 Understanding one’s health requires understanding one’s environment, because culture and technology affects both what we do inexplicitly and unconsciously]]
	Barefoot shoes and toe
	Mobile phones and posture
	Pirahas' body dimensions are constant

**You have to look at the whole of culture:**
[[10-1b Culture is set of ideas which affect behavior including unconscious ones like skills, expectations, and emotional preferences.]]
[[10-1b6 Culture ⇒ Culturally invented symbols ⇒ Language (Culture invents things. Everyone is part of a culture. Every individual learning take place within culture. Every invention is built up over time, including language.)]]
[[10-2g2e6a Science is about understanding the whole of reality, of which only an infinitesimal proportion is ever experienced]]
	[[10-2f1 Chomsky’s UG approach only looks at a subset (syntax) of a subset (language) of the whole (communication system — ‘the gestalt’). Syntax is only secondary to conversation.]]

**However, we are still biologically affected as well:**
[[1-2g1e Our biological bodies are (still) encoded in genes. Often times it is helpful to understand our biological-default tendencies-biases.]]
