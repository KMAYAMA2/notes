[[10-2g1 Culture is an implicit theory for its members. It dictates what to look at and how they reason about the world.]]
[[5-2b4 Explanation (explicit or inexplicit) precedes both your options and choices]]

[[10-1b4d '好み' = ミメシスからパロディアへ]]

Crazy connection:
[[RUL3 - Write out your goals. It’s amazing how few people do.]]
[[5-1b1a8c 決断 ≠ 判断 (the former precedes the latter — why you start out with some end-state of the world you’d like to achieve and live in)]]
[[3-1b Be flexible with the problem itself, because you may not know what’s the real problem yet]]
[[2-1a Information is in the difference. No difference, no information. 情報とは差異. 区別のないところに情報は生まれない.]]
