- [[5-1b1a2 Some technology contains knowledge which can be universal. You can’t predict how people will use such technology.]]
- [[10-2g3d1 Humans do stupid things because we can guess and create meanings. Other life-forms don't have that ability to create knowledge actively. Our ability comes with a great cost of potentially doing very (infinitely) stupid things.]]

- [[9-1b2a Technology can be invented via individuals as well as via groups of people, but both can’t do away with their own constraints (i.e., their contingency)]]

- Put differently: humans are universal explainers, hence unpredictable

- Humans are universal because they can create knowledge thereby explanations. Knowledge can be created only with universal epistemology, more specifically, with Popperian epistemology. Errors can be corrected when the knowledge is represented by universal symbols. Symbols universalize humans.

- [[10-2g2c1 Symbols are universal. Being arbitrary and contingent means it can represent anything, and do everything.]]
