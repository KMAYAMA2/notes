*You can replace 'interpretant' with 'culture'*
	[[9-2b3a There is no universal culture, because culture is contingency (文化 = 上澄み)]]
		There is no universal interpretant ([[9-2b3e2 There is no universal symbol-idea (in the sense of capable of conveying universal meaning)]]) #develop

	Quantum information (qubit) and interpretant. What is information? Can there be 'core' of information which doesn't admit any 'interpretant'?
		[[3-1c2e0 There is no minimum idea]]

Interpretants are constructed of other interpretants

And one needs 'interpretant' to understand anything (e.g., conversation as well as non-verbal communication ):
	To answer someone's question thoroughly, he has to understand why the questioner is asking HIM the question, as well as the context of how that question has emerged. And you can't really understand any of them fully because that will demand exhaustive description of the counterpart, which is impossible ([[5-1b1a2c0 No theory can exhaust reality]], partly because [[5-1b1a2c0.1 Perfect replication is impossible]]). This is why culture is essential for any communication (both verbal and non-verbal) to go through, because without shared values and assumptions, communication becomes too burdensome. Culture begets interpretant. 
		Again, you can replace interpretant with culture! #develop
