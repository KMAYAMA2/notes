- The power of composability:
  - **Saves keystrokes** #develop 
    - Composability is software's version of compounding interest
---
- Composability = Interoperability ([[6-3b2b Interoperability implies composability]]) #develop 
  - Interoperability is a tool for growth in blockchain networks
    - E.g., transferring goods from other games ([[6-3b2a Interoperability implies compounding]])
      - It'll be like in the IRL (e.g., physical skills, physical connections, physical assets)
				- Digital skills-connections-assets aren't fully owned by users within corporate networks

- “Attestations”
  - The advantages of storing media attestations on blockchains:
    - 1. _Transparent and immutable_ ([[4-1a4b3b A blockchain constitution means an immutable topic to be discussed]])
    - 2. _Credible neutrality_ ([[To be universal, protocols must be unopinionated]], [[Truly open means no intermediary]])
    - 3. _Composability_
      - Third parties could build reputation systems that evaluate the track records of attesters, assigning trust scores
				- Tech is derivative (derivative is tech, [[7-1d2a5 Tech shapes tech]])
