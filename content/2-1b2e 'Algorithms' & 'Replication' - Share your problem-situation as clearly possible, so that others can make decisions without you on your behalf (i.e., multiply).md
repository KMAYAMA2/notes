- [[9-1b1 Ideas are never replicated fully because each individual has different problem-situation. Meme variation (and mutation) is inevitable.]]


*[[2-1b2e1 Understanding comes from copying the information-knowledge as information-knowledge medium; not from copying the substrate]]*

	- *“Do they know what you value most?” I hesitated. He looked me square in the eye. “Shane, do you know what you value most?” I stared at him blankly. He sighed. “The problem isn’t your team. It’s you. You don’t know what’s most important. Until you do, your team will never make decisions without you. It’s too risky for them to figure out the most important thing. Communicate that to your team, and they’ll be able to make decisions on their own.”*
- *INDIVIDUAL*
	- *Remember: the goal isn’t to have someone tell you what to do; rather, it’s to learn how an expert thinks about the problem, which variables they consider relevant, and how those variables interact over time. If you ask them how they think about the problem, that’s when you start deepening your understanding.*

**On copy-pasting behaviors:**
- You can't imitate your way to greatness because you can only copy the effect, not the cause
- [[9-1b0 Knowledge (both explicit and inexplicit) is created individually. You don’t say “I took it from him.” You can’t blame “he took it from me.”]]
- [[10-2g1f1 Natural selection can only operate on phenotypes (physical attributes) and not on genotypes (the knowledge bearing entity). The same (or similar) phenotypes doesn’t mean they share the same genotype.]]

- It's an equivalent of building a communication system, and it can be implemented on-chain with proper incentives.
