#Ayache and the 'slip'
- [[1-2g2j1d Cantgotu environments - you will always be proven wrong because no program will render it; you can never prove that you were there]]
- [[3-1a4b5 Anything can be priced in principle. But not everything will be.]]
- [[4-1a4b3d The 'ledger of record' shifts the focus to adjacent layers]]
- [[8-2b4 You don't (and can't) put everything on-chain, just as you don't (and can't) put everything online]]
- [[5-1b1a2c0.2 Analogue information (e.g., tones of voice, EQ) cannot be perfectly-exhaustively represented by digital systems (e.g., universal writing systems)]]

[[9-1b1 Ideas are never replicated fully because each individual has different problem-situation. Meme variation (and mutation) is inevitable.]]
	[[2-1b2e2 Knowledge doesn't care how it's replicated and its impact on the knowledge bearing entities. What matters is whether the content is replicated, and there's space for creativity and variation here.]]

We don't have to achieve perfect replication because [[5-3b Knowledge creates new frontiers (and new markets)]]
	Just like how BSM created options market

Imitation already involves icon (パロディア) #develop
