- The multiverse implies fungibility. We find the multiverse in explaining fungibility found in quantum phenomena:
- [[1-2g2t4 Because fungibility exists (i.e., histories DO rejoin) we must evoke the multiverse. The multiverse emerged from quantum physics (genealogically).]]
- [[1-2g2s5 When the instances are fungible, there is no such thing as 'which' - histories and individual particles are not perfectly partitioned into instances]]
- But remember: the multiverse exists objectively.
- [[1-2g2s6a The multiverse is the objective reality. Each universe is an emergent phenomenon in the context of this reality.]]
