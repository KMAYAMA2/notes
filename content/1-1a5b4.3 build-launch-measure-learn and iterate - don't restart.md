	        - basically leading qs (they are with assumptions)
	            - “how do u like it?” (resto example)
	            - “what u think about my idea”
	            - “wud u use my app everyday?”
	            - “feature request?”
	            - “wud u pay money for this?”
	    - better q:
	        - make it about their life, not ur project. ask about their habits/experience to gain insight on how to improve ur own idea
	            - “what does the taste reminds u of?” (resto example)
