> “Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things.” – T. S. Eliot

Artist does his things for the sake of it—they might turn out to be helpful for him later, but that is not his primary concern. In other words, he doesn’t do it for himself. He doesn’t allow his personal problems to get in the way of it. Art is when it’s done for its own sake and nothing else. There is no room for personality there. [[3-1c3c5 Best of all is when you can say they would’ve found this had they taken their own ideas seriously |Impersonality]] is the defining character of the artist.

This is why the artist often looks *stupid* from the outside. What he does isn’t helping him most of the time—so it doesn’t make sense to other people. But he keeps doing it. And the only reason why he keeps at it, despite getting no immediate returns, is because he’s having fun. Your whole being is engaged when you are having fun—and [[9-2b3h Edward Sapir - 'One is always unconsciously finding what one is in unconscious subjection to' |your whole being]] is always bigger than your problems. This is another defining character of the artist—he is immersed in the present. Problem solving, on the other hand, always anticipate the future. 

Be an artist first, then occasionally solve problems. Not vice versa. And solve only [[3-1b2 Use the Fun Criterion to filter what problems to work on |fun]] problems.
