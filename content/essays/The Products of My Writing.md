##### What Are My Notes For?
Some comments on my reddit post (where I shared my [notes](https://kenti.xyz/notes/)) took me by surprise the other day, “You are taking notes for the sake of taking notes,” “What are you working on?” “What did you produce with it?” [1]

Writing has to address problems, and going through [[1-1c4b You always have to solve problems, including the problem of what problems to solve |life]]—it’s full of problems. So, naturally, when you write something you can end up addressing your life’s problems. 

But that’s not it—writing also makes your [[5-2b1b Writing down makes it easier for your conscious to see the unconscious |unconscious]] problems conscious. Writing works [[1-1a5a A real essay doesn’t take a position and then defend it (deductive). It starts with a question (abductive), in trying to figure something out. |both ways]]—it helps you with your problems, including [[5-1b5 Keep solving problems including the problem of what problems to solve |the problem]] of what problems to solve.

And taking these notes did help me with my real life decisions—both professional and personal. I thought about them clearly because I wrote about them: where to work, what to invest in, to get married. These were problems to be solved—and I solved them with writing. You [[5-2 What counts cannot be counted |can’t read]] them, but those decisions were my products.

I write [[7-1a Create something you would want for yourself, and never for some imaginary audience |primarily for myself]]—for my own problems, and to find the next problems to work on. Does that mean my notes are useless to everyone else? I don’t think so. They can help you too—if [[3-1c3c0 Ideas have timing |the timing is right]]. [2]

Life happens with pen and paper, but it happens outside of it.

**Notes**
[1] Is doing anything for its own sake a problem? Isn’t that the definition of [[Become A Problem-Solving Artist|art]]?
[2] But in writing this essay, I realized that I did put my notes in public for the sake of *going public*. My next problem is figuring out what to *[[9-3 Increase surface area of luck |learn]] in public*.
