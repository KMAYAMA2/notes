I love good open world video games. I spent 150+ hours into Elden Ring. One thing I love about that game is that it doesn’t have any official narrative—you have to figure out what happened in that world by collecting in-game items and piecing together the texts written in them. You have to [[1-1a6 To live is to live like a detective |guess]] everything, much like in the real world. 

Each item has its own utility in itself. But when we piece their text together to form plausible narratives, we give more meaning to each items. When the item becomes a part of your narrative, its meaning becomes richer although the text stays the same. Items both [[1-2g1c3e When you connect ideas, the content doesn't change but meanings change |don’t change yet do change]] at the same time.

The deeper you go into the game, the items will assume more meanings, and your narratives will get more complicated. And it’s reflexive—the items are building blocks for your narratives, although it’s the narratives that dictate what to look for in items (and what items to look for). It’s always the narratives that [[5-2b5 Theories precede data |precede]]. [1]

So when collecting items, you’re figuring out your narratives in two directions. One is forward-looking—*what new narratives can I create with this one?* Another is self-reflective and often [[1-1c5 Surprises are the doors to revealing the inexplicit and the unconscious |unconscious]]—*what made me pick this item’s this part in text, over that part (or over that item)?* The good news is that you don’t have to think about this to enjoy the game. I don’t even do the collecting part to do the guessing—I just watch other people making theories on YouTube, which I as much as the gameplay itself. [2]

But reality is really open world. There are infinitely more items. There are infinitely more narratives. There’s no equivalent of in-game and not-in-game distinction in real life because everything is in-life—watching other people’s theories counts as collecting items. Quantities and categories are [[3-1d6a1 Staying consistent is rather difficult with information abundance. What we need is purpose-intention. |abundant]] in reality.

So we need some constraints—[[3-1d6 Constraints in the form of consistent style leave space for creativity and progress |guidance]]—in real life. Good open world games do have some [[1-1a2e7b You need some form of constraints to see anything |constraints]]. The thrill is at the edge of what’s possible and impossible—you don’t get that if you’re allowed to do anything and everything.

My [notes](https://kenti.xyz/notes/) are such constraints. [[What my notes are for |They]] are my in-game items—except this time the game is my real [[2-1b2b2.1 Life is a multiplicative game—take advantage of network effects but avoid the risk of ruin |life]]. They are [[9-4b3e1 Concise explanations accelerate. It helps others understand you better and faster at all scales. |concise]] by design—most of them consist of one or two sentences. It’s easy to piece them together and create new ones. On days I’m forward-looking, I will [[3-1c3c1 To create is to recombine. Innovation happens when ideas have sex (either between people or with one’s past ideas). Exchange is to technology as sex is to evolution. |combine]] them to create essays with new ideas or narratives. 

But sometimes I will be self-reflective—and my [[1-1a5a A real essay doesn’t take a position and then defend it (deductive). It starts with a question (abductive), in trying to figure something out. |essay]] will be about why I created this or that specific note. Such essays will go deeper than notes—they are attempts to articulate the already [[1-2g3 The sphere of comprehensibility expands infinitely |articulate]]. Such essays will cut through my unconscious narratives—it’ll be longer and more roundabout, but it’ll be the most economical, like all [rivers](https://www.paulgraham.com/laundry.html) in nature.

**Notes**
[1] In philosophical terms: Elden Ring understands Popper, and players are forced to engage with Popperian epistemology during the gameplay due to its lack of official narratives. No wonder I spent so much time on that game (and more on writing).
[2] And the gameplay itself is great enough without any narratives.
