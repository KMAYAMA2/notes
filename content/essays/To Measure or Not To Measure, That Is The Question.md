##### Because Time Flies When You’re Having Fun
I was reading about the science behind endurance sports. Apparently the key to endurance is in managing not just how you feel—but in managing the difference between how you feel and what you expected to feel at that point. The lesson here probably applies to all things in life, not just for running. 

Humans rarely go beyond their physical limit, because the brain puts a brake on the body before your physiological capacities hits the limit. It’s your brain’s perception of effort—which is the difference between how you feel and what you expected to feel—that dictates the body and its performance. And by default the brain is very protective, making sure you only break mentally. 

The story of Diane Van Deren is quite telling. She became an ultra-marathon runner after her brain surgery affected both her sense of time and direction. She can’t remember the distance she covered and the time it took. So she can’t suffer from her own expectations—because she doesn’t have any. Her brain doesn’t provide her with the normal perception of effort. Yet that’s precisely what keeps her going. One step at a time—she’s always at present. [1] [2]

And now elite runners and cyclists are trying to exploit this brain-body dynamics. *Can we trick the brain? What if we can trick both how we feel and our expectation of it—that is, the perception of effort?* That’s what they work on. And trainers are already seeing the expected results from their athletes.

Although the book is for runners and cyclists, I couldn’t stop thinking about its implications elsewhere. I don’t want my expectation to limit what’s capable of me. If the key to endurance is in minimizing the perception of effort, then the best strategy is to measure less metrics—or not at all. 

Runners can do this by only measuring either the time or the distance, but not both at the same time. For example, he can set his timer to 60 minutes and just run for 60 minutes at pace which he feels effortless without checking how many miles he covered. This practice won’t make him an elite runner, but it’s the best strategy if he wants to make running his long-term [[5-1b4c1b You can easily replace the self-discipline with the four laws of habit formation - (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying |habit]]. [3] 

Fortunately (or unfortunately) the metrics for life is more multivariant than any endurance sports—your measurement isn’t just about the distance covered and the time it took. It could be how much money you have, how many fans you have, how fit you are, how good you look, how happy you are—it could be anything. You can adopt more and more criteria—with corresponding sufferings. [4]

Measuring less in life means having a [[RUL3 - Always be ready to face the ultimate choice. Know what's important for you. Eliminate ambiguity. |priority]]. As [[Naval Ravikant |Naval]] says, it’s way more important to perfect your desires than to try to do something you don’t 100 percent desire. 

Yet, the most effective strategy in life is to not measure at all. And that means doing something for its own sake. We can be our versions of Diane Van Deren—because *time flies when you’re having fun*, and *you’ll forget to measure*. Have fun, then you won’t suffer fighting consciously against our wanting to measure. You’ll be doubly effortless.

The added benefit of not measuring by yourself is that you’re letting others measure you. And you might find some of their measurements surprising. You might figure out what you’re [[5-1b1b2b Don't try to be the best. Be the only. |the best]] at by being open to others’ measurements. [5]

Sometimes less is more—and occasionally none can be more.

**Notes**
[1] Haruki Murakami (who’s also a runner): “Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.”
[2] Which reminds me of the Stoics and Buddhists. They both teach us to accept the reality as it is—to have no expectation. No expectation, no difference, no suffering. Stoics and Buddhists are resilient, and probably will make good endurance athletes.
[3] Or he can just stop measuring both. He can just run.
[4] It’s similar to how [[3-1a4b5 Anything can be priced in principle. But not everything will be. |anything can be priced in principle]], although price (like any measurement) too [[3-1a4b4 Not everything are priced yet |will never be exhaustive]].
[5] Just like how a great athlete needs a great coach who can provide him with unique feedback, a great creator needs a great audience. Let’s be encouraging to one another (especially on the internet).

This is probably why the gaming guru Sakurai recommends to keep the difficulty-reward correlation in games unpredictable and complex. Simple difficulty-reward correlation games aren’t enjoyable.
