##### Thoughtfully Go Tangent

[[Will Guidara]] created the best restaurant in the world by pursuing what he calls *unreasonable* hospitality. [[Naval Ravikant |Naval]] says that the winners of any game are the people who are so addicted they continue playing even as the marginal utility from winning declines. Think of Steve Jobs—do you think he was reasonable?

This had me thinking what it means to be reasonable, and if there’s anything that’s rational in itself. For instance, are the laws of physics rational? I don’t think so—otherwise we wouldn’t be enjoying ([[1-2g2s6a The multiverse is the objective reality. Each universe is an emergent phenomenon in the context of this reality. |good]]) science fictions. The question is meaningless to Mother Nature. The laws of physics are just that—the laws of physics.

People always told me to be rational, to be reasonable. But their *reasonable* was always in the context with something external—their culture. Most people are reasonably reasonable. And they are boring, because their reasonableness is preceded by their culture. Culture [[10-2g1 Culture is an implicit theory for its members. It dictates what to look at and how they reason about the world. |dictates]] what’s reasonable for them. 

But there are also people who go completely tangent with other people’s expectation. Think of Galileo and Newton—they were definitely not reasonable back then. Their formulation—the laws of physics—apply to all things equally, maybe because they didn’t care about their culture. And see what happened. They created their own [[10-2g1a Science emerged from culture |culture]]. [1] [2]

[1] How do you become unreasonably reasonable? By becoming [[Become A Problem-Solving Artist|an artist]].
