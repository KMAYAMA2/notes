- [[10-2g2c0a Universal systems retain the capacity to represent knowledge that is not yet created, thus can be useful in the future.]]
- [[5-1b1a2c0.2 Analogue information (e.g., tones of voice, EQ) cannot be perfectly-exhaustively represented by digital systems (e.g., universal writing systems)]]
- [[10-2g2c0 A system is universal if it contains enough expressibility to represent anything. It can do anything and everything.]]
