- Pike’s _emicization_
    - The _emic_ vs. _etic_
        - _Etic_: outsider
            - The etic approach = ‘Comparative’
        - _Emic_: insider
            - The emic approach = ‘Culturally specific, applied to one language or culture at a time’
	            - Pike: “Regardless of how much training one has . . . emic units of a language must be determined during the analysis of that language; they must be discovered, not predicted (*emphasis by Everett*) ([[1-1a4b2 Problems arise only when you reason via abduction]], [[1-1c4 To be surprised is to be mistaken]]) — even though the range of kinds of components of language has restrictions placed upon it by the physiology of the human organism”

- Individual apperceptions + A ranked-value, linguistic-based model of culture ⇒ Human unconscious
- Culture articulates the unconscious via emicization, learning how and that, value rankings, knowledge structures, and social relations and roles across various groups
    - What has been most emicized is most deeply unconscious by and large
        - **We have both conscious and unconscious yet the latter is also not innately structured** 
  - [[1-1a2a2 The inexplicit and unconscious is also NOT innately structured]]
            - Doing, thinking, talking, experiencing ⇒ Interpreting those experiences ⇒ The unconscious
