- Originally, *But everything can be priced*

- [[8-1a What can go digital will go digital]]
	- [[3-1d4b1 What’s been considered ‘analog’ must be represented digitally, because the distinction is rather arbitrary]]
		- [[12-1c Open source means more composability means more digitizeable and measurables]]

- E.g., prediction market, [every polity will be traded like stocks] #develop

- [[3-1a4b4 Not everything are priced yet]]
	- [[7-1a4a1 Wealth created ≠ the P&L of a business. Remember - you get what you measure.]]
		- But with technology we'd be able to capture wealth rather arbitrarily well:
			- E.g., [[3-1c1d5 Dashboards over newspapers]]
				- [[3-1c1c You must build your own media for yourself]]
				- [[3-1c1d You must build your own media distribution to avoid distortion for yourself and others]]

- Yet remember: [[5-1b1a2c0 No theory can exhaust reality]]
	- Put differently, no pricing model can price everything because there's always something that *slips* #Ayache

- [[5-2a3 People fight over tangibles]]
	- [[12-1a2a2 資本は資本の一元性を好み、商品は商品の多様性を好む]]
