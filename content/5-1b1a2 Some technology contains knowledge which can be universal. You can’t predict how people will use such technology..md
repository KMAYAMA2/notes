- Or maybe more to do with [[4-1a4b6b When ideas are exposed to various contexts (i.e., different people-place-time) they often find unexpected match. Ideas have timing.]] Because [[9-2b3e3 There is no universal knowledge]] #develop

- [[5-1b1a2a Any instantiation of knowledge (meaning every technology and representation) will have its own restraints]]
- [[5-1b1a3 We are more than technology, because we create knowledge-technology. We are more than functions. Don’t be a function.]]

***Symbols are universal:***
- [[10-2g2c0a Universal systems retain the capacity to represent knowledge that is not yet created, thus can be useful in the future.]]
- [[10-2g2c0 A system is universal if it contains enough expressibility to represent anything. It can do anything and everything.]]
- [[10-2g2c1 Symbols are universal. Being arbitrary and contingent means it can represent anything, and do everything.]]

- More precisely: universal system can create knowledge, hence unpredictable.

- [[1-2b In the quest for truth, what matters is the explanation and not where it came from, because even if gods reveal something to you it’s just as fallible as ever (the quest for truth ≠ a quest for certainty-justification-necessity)]]
- [[9-4b2a1b Build the Idea Maze - Explain the history around an idea, and why yours is a good one. Virtually render the history of the evolution of that idea.]]
- [[9-4c Someone who never writes has no fully formed ideas about anything nontrivial]]
- Technology can contain knowledge accidentally, just like biological evolution, but we can create knowledge intentionally. We can explain how some technology can contain knowledge.
