*These are related in the sense that good explanations are hard to come by, and scientific theories are prime examples of good explanations that are hard to vary. That that less fallibility comes from scientific community's constraints (shared symbols, shared knowledge structure, shared culture). That if you can form a good Idea Maze, that is as good as forming an accurate virtual-reality. That good explanations are hard to come by means if you find one that can become great barriers to entry for others.*
