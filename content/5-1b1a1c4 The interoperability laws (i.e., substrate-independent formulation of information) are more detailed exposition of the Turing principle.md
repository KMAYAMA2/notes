- Substrate-independence implies the Turing principle. Or maybe the opposite: the Turing principle implies substrate-independence. Or maybe it's just the same thing conceptualized differently.
	***If my second postulate is true, that means substrate-independence can be only realized by beings which can use symbols. That is, humans.*** ([[10-2g2e Universality of the laws of physics depends on the existence of universal explainers â€” people]]) #develop

- Classical information: *possibility* of 'flip' and 'copy' #develop
- Quantum information: *impossibility* (Heisenberg uncertainty principle) of copying certain information-carrying states and *possibility* of reversing any transformation #develop
	- [[1-2g2t5a There is no such thing as the 'same' instance of a particle at different times - i.e., there is no such thing as speed of 'one instance' in the quantum physics (Heisenberg uncertainty principle)]]
		- [[1-2g2t5b The term 'uncertainty principle' is doubly misleading because first of all fungibility is a physical fact and not uncertainty of anything, and second of all because it can be derived from more general principle of quantum physics]]
