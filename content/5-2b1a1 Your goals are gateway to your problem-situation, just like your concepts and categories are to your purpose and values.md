[[3-1b0 Think forward, but also think in reverse via inversion]]
[[3-1b1 Occasionally revisit the problem itself. Occasionally check in on long-term.]]
[[10-2g1 Culture is an implicit theory for its members. It dictates what to look at and how they reason about the world.]]
[[10-2g4 Cultures and languages are reflexive]]
[[1-1c5 Surprises are the doors to revealing the inexplicit and the unconscious]]

[[5-2b1a2 When you invert, you are inverting the problem-situation itself (’why do I have this problem’)]]

*[[7-1a4b Understanding the measurement-constraints amounts to understanding the system-incentives. That is, creating explanations.]]*
- Categories and concepts are somewhat subsidiary to the purpose and problems they serve
- Problems themselves are also indicative of the framework (could be either explicit or inexplicit worldview) from which they arise. However, we can't construct the exact explanatory framework from the problems it created.
- We can’t fully explain categories and concepts as others understand/use them even after invoking their explanatory frameworks from their problems and values.
- Each problem-situation can never be interpreted the same by different individuals (or even by the same individual at different times). This means uniform understanding is impossible.
	- Problems themselves are signs and have to be interpreted
	- In short, each individual has to come up with an explanation not just during  problem-solving phase but also during problem-defining phase!
		- [[2-1a6c1a 'First-conclusion bias' - Separate the problem-defining phase of the decision-making process form the problem-solving phase]]
	- We can’t use anything as how it’s used by others
		- We can’t have the same exact problem-situation
			- As well as concepts, categories, purposes, and goals
				- [[9-1b1 Ideas are never replicated fully because each individual has different problem-situation. Meme variation (and mutation) is inevitable.]]
				- [[9-1b1a It almost never happens that two minds hold precisely the same idea]]
				- [[10-2f3a1 Speaking the same language doesn’t mean they share the same exact meanings.]]
- We need constraints including categories to think but we transcend them
	- *Use categories, but don't be categorized:*
		- [[3-1a3 Multidisciplinary thinking is the most realistic thinking]]
		- [[8-1c5 Look for Lollapalooza, or system equivalent of critical mass, or chemical equivalent of activation energy, alloying, and catalysts]]
