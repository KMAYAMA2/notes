- Richard Hamming: *"Great thoughts only on Friday afternoons"*
- “What will be the role of computers in all of AT&T?”, “How will computers change science?”, “What will be the impact of computers on science and how can I change it?”, “How is it going to change Bell Labs?”
	- *"I thought hard about where was my field going, where were the opportunities, and what were the important things to do. Let me go there so there is a chance I can do important things."* ([[7-1b4f Let the tech decide where to go (both intellectually and physically)]])
		- [[QUE5 - Ask “am I working on what I most want to work on” because per-project procrastination is far worse than daily procrastination]]
			- [[3-1b2 Use the Fun Criterion to filter what problems to work on]]
				- [[QUE5 - What’s the best thing you could be working on, and why aren’t you]]
					- [[7-1a1a3 If you know that others can solve certain problems, let them. Only work on important problems worth focusing on.]]
						- [[7-1b5a You can create problems. Not in the sense of causing problems, but literally creatively creating them. There are good problems and bad problems. Work on and solve good problems.]]
							- [[7-1a5 Startups work on technology because great ideas made viable by newest tech (itself a new technology) is the best source of rapid change and growth]]

		- [[6-4 Proper epistemology should lead to a proper state of mind]]

***[[3-1c1c You must build your own media for yourself]]***

- You are what you read. You think like who you follow.
	- [[2-1a1a3a You're the average of your five closest friends OR You're the average of the people whose content you consume the most]]

- [[RUL3 - Write out your goals. It’s amazing how few people do.]]
- [[5-1b4b Compounding is usually too slow to notice. You have to be deliberate in how you think and what you see.]]
	- [[2-1a0c1c Purpose (and curiosity) beats for-profit]]
		- [[3-1c1d0 We are overconsuming novelty (and “serendipity”) and under-consuming purpose. The first thing to look at each day should be your purpose and metrics to improve upon, not some random stories.]]
			- [[3-1d6a1 Staying consistent is rather difficult with information abundance. What we need is purpose-intention.]]
				- [[5-2d When you are purpose-goal-oriented, you'll be problem-project-oriented, because you will face problems in the process of achieving the former and will break them down into mini-problems]]
