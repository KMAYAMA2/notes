- [[1-2g2s4 Everyday objects are partitioned into nearly autonomous histories with one instance-position-speed, but every atom in those objects is a multiversal object not partitioned (i.e., fungible)]]

- [[1-2g2t5a There is no such thing as the 'same' instance of a particle at different times - i.e., there is no such thing as speed of 'one instance' in the quantum physics (Heisenberg uncertainty principle)]]
- [[1-2g2t5b The term 'uncertainty principle' is doubly misleading because first of all fungibility is a physical fact and not uncertainty of anything, and second of all because it can be derived from more general principle of quantum physics]]

- We can't test both definite path and superposition simultaneously (intractability) but that allows us to recalibrate the interference effect and get predictable outcome (from quantum 'unpredictability'!). Put differently, intractability is most clearly manifested in quantum phenomena that are highly predictable. Intractable doesn't mean unpredictable.
  - [[1-2g2c3 Intractable does not mean unpredictable]]
    - [[1-2g2t6 The effect of interference on a history depends on what other histories are present (e.g., Mach-Zehnder interferometer)]]
