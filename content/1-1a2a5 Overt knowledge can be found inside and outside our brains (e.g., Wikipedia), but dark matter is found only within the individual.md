- My thought from this excerpt:
  - *[[8-1a What can go digital will go digital]] argument is similar to **what can go global will go global** argument. It's true, but that comes with the cost of doing away with most of what constitute culture, that is, the inexplicit (and remember that [[1-1a2e5 Cultures nurture minds]]!). It's easy to disregard them precisely because they are inexplicit and ineffable ([[5-2 What counts cannot be counted]]). That doesn't mean they don't exist, however. And even if we think we can do away with the cultural, that is not so because knowledge cannot be replicated perfectly ([[1-1a2e8 'Seeing' really occurs after going through (or together with) emicization]]; [[1-1a2e9b When 'properly' emicized by the culture, we see what's not there and can not see what's there]]; [[10-1b2a Emicization = The construction of an insider point of view (the 'dark matter')]]). Even scientific communities cannot do away with being enmeshed in the web of meanings - value rankings, knowledge structures, social roles, and so on ([[10-2g1a Science emerged from culture]]). Assuming otherwise is the same as assuming **globalization will proceed smoothly without any pushbacks from nation-states** argument, or assuming **financial theories will apply to reality exhaustively without conflict and mismatch** argument (DM3, ソロス)*
    - Does the same critique apply to *what can be priced will be priced* argument? ([[3-1a4b5 Anything can be priced in principle. But not everything will be.]]) #develop

- Put differently:
- Algorithms can't accommodate dark matter
  - [[5-1b1a2d Knowledge is by definition unpredictable]]
    - [[10-2h Explicating the inexplicit amounts to knowledge, and knowledge is unpredictable, and never derived mechanically]] ([[1-1a5 We always reason abductively]]; [[1-1a2e4 Cultures precede languages]]; [[5-2b4 Explanation (explicit or inexplicit) precedes both your options and choices]])

  - The genetic code as a language for specifying organisms displays phenomenal reach, but we don’t have an explanation for its universality. [[We do not yet understand the nature of the universality of the DNA replication system]]. #develop

- Is it true that [[8-3a Robotics will be the new demographics]]?
