Understand anything digitally. Analysis means formulating the true cause-and-effect relationships. One reason piecemeal error correction works better is because you know with which part you are experimenting with. When you change everything at once, it's tough to dissect the culprit. And usually such culprits are small things. You don't rewrite the whole script when the code is buggy. You debug line by line. And that how we should approach life and why [[3-1d6b Consistent style makes it easier to see whether you are making a progress or not]].
