**Being able to measure implies that the measurer is both already emicized and digitized (パロディア); measurable means it's interoperable (i.e., *it could've been otherwise*); we measure something to the extent that we know what's been measured is not necessary, that it is a variable rather than a constant ([[12-1a Turning constants into variables increases volatility]]); measuring implies symbols, and symbols imply culture; culture precedes measuring** #develop
