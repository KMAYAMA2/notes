	*Create technology that solves unsolved problems and you create a market*
    - Or use existent technology and solve hitherto thought of unsolvable problems
      - E.g., most automation happens indirectly ([[8-1b2 Digital-physical is entwined]])

					- [[7-1a6a Successful founders see different problems]]
						- E.g., Nvidia is now THE platform for AI infrastructure #develop
							* Jensen technically created new language (legacy CUDA) which translated mathematics used in machine learning for computers-processors
