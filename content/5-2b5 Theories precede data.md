- 2. [[1-1a2e4 Cultures precede languages]] ([[10-2g1 Culture is an implicit theory for its members. It dictates what to look at and how they reason about the world.]])
- 3. [[4-1a5b Your problems precede any conversations]]
- 4. [[5-2b4 Explanation (explicit or inexplicit) precedes both your options and choices]]
- 5. [[10-2e7 The common-sense concept of cause and effect makes sense because 'variants' do exist somewhere in the multiverse. Nothing necessitates causes to precede their effects.]]
- 6. [[1-2g2b3a Both Great Simulator and all-possible-computer-programs-are-running arguments are bad explanations because computation doesn't precede physical world and its laws.]] (Contradiction with #5 is worth exploring because [[12-1e Nothing is necessary = Everything is contingent]])
- 7. [[1-1a4b0b According to Peirce, mathematics precedes all other fields of study, and only studies imbued with a strong mathematical foundation were worthy of the label ‘science’. Mathematics cannot be derived from logic.]] (Remember: [[12-1e Nothing is necessary = Everything is contingent]])
