- Blockchain networks externalize tasks
	- Tasks held captive proprietary in corporate networks go become market-based!
		- Paradoxically, [[6-3b3d Externalized incentives (negative externalities) go away when everything is externalized]] #develop 
			- Similar to how [[8-2b2 The most efficient business is one with trust, or one completely without]]!
	- Wider talent funnel and the base of network stakeholders
- Permissionless means it privileges no app developers = Truly peer-to-peer
	- [[9-1b0a When you have learned something, the way it exists in your mind is the same as the way it exists in the mind of the inventor]] (Inventor = Learner)
		- [[8-1c2a What matters is the creativity per se, because non-creative parts will be made easier]]
	- [[6-3b3b Not differentiating developers from users mean what attracts the former also attracts the latter, and vice versa]]!
