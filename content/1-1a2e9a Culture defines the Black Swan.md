- Counterexamples and exceptions are etically the same but emically very different
  - The former is taken seriously, while the latter is ignored 'safely'
  - The classification depends on our dark matter
- In the value system of the theory of dark matter here, these are the following values:
- 1. Understanding particulars is vital and is the first step in developing an etically valid basis for emic science. #develop
- 2. There is no atheoretical research, so be informed.
        - We are theory-laden! 
  - [[10-2g2c0b There is no a priori - 直観は存在しない]]
- 3. Using insights from multiple theories can mitigate the counterexample vs. exception quandary.

- 4. Never be too sure.
	    - [[1-2 We are fallible]]
- 5. The same structure can be a counterexample in one language but a pseudo-exception in another, depending on the “field/matrix” view (or in some cases, the “dynamic” or “wave” view).
