- The Turing principle connects physics and knowledge (subsequently biology):
- [[1-2g2r The Turing principle, if true, dictates that we can form accurate theories about reality. Knowledge to the Turing principle is what steam engines are to the principles of thermodynamics. That is, the Turing principle implies knowledge.]]
	- [[1-2g2b2 The Turing principle is also about the correspondence between the two bodies, and knowledge is not necessarily embodied in the human mind]]
		- [[1-2g2h Life is associated with a fundamental principle of physics – the Turing principle – since it is the means by which virtual reality was first realized in nature. (Life = physical embodiment of knowledge = the Turing principle)]]
