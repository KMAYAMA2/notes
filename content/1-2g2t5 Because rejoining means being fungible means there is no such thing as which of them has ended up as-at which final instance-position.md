- [[1-2g2s5 When the instances are fungible, there is no such thing as 'which' - histories and individual particles are not perfectly partitioned into instances]]
- [[1-2g2s6 The reality does not make distinction of the universes in the multiverse because each universe exists equally as a part of the multiverse]]
- [[1-2g2s7 There is no universe number 1 or number 2 because that would make them non-fungible (as well as implying some transcendental perspective). There is no point asking which event we will experience.]]

- [[1-2g2t5a There is no such thing as the 'same' instance of a particle at different times - i.e., there is no such thing as speed of 'one instance' in the quantum physics (Heisenberg uncertainty principle)]]
- [[1-2g2t6 The effect of interference on a history depends on what other histories are present (e.g., Mach-Zehnder interferometer)]]
