Kevin Kelly: *"Watch people make"*

[[7-1b3a Don’t argue. Build. Their incomprehension is your moat.]]

[[9-4c2 'Programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.' 'Design to express algorithms, and only incidentally tell machines how to execute them.']]

[[1-1a2a4 The flexibility of humans are found particularly in the tacit knowledge]]

**[[2-1a4 'Language instinct' - Language can't exhaust mind]]**
	**[[2-1a7a5 Build day by day unless anything fundamental ('the core') changed. Superficial-uncontrollable criteria (e.g., share price) matter less.]]**
		**[[7-1b3a Don’t argue. Build. Their incomprehension is your moat.]]**

***[[2-1a4c We don't know how we create knowledge yet, but that doesn't mean we can't]]***
