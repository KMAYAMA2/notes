###### Writing to Learn
- [[9-1b0c Reality doesn't differentiate reading-thinking-writing-playing-doing-investing-building |Writing is a form of thinking]]—those who think clearly can write as well as the best writer.
	- “Writing and thinking and learning were the same process.”
		- But writing is more physical than reading because you put your thoughts on paper—making it easier for you to see the gap between what you want to say and how you said it. That [[2-1a Information is in the difference. No difference, no information. 情報とは差異. 区別のないところに情報は生まれない. |difference is a useful piece of information]].
- Learning—[[2-1a4a Sometimes the best information is the least transmissible. |expect to find them in places where you least expect them to be]].
	- [[1-1c5 Surprises are the doors to revealing the inexplicit and the unconscious |Surprise is the key to learning]].
- [[3-1a The reality doesn’t have categories, there are only problems to be solved. Be problem-project-oriented. 'Academic subjects' are mere social constructs. |Knowledge is not compartmented]]—it’s all one house "and “writing is the key that opens the door."
- [[10-1b4a Learning is imitation and testing |Learn by imitation]]. Read your favorite writers, and study them.
- **[[The essence of writing is rewriting]]**.
	- Very few can say what they want to say on their first try.
		- It’s important to iterate—[[1-1a5b4.3 build-launch-measure-learn and iterate - don't restart |the same with startups]].
- You need good, clean sentences. But you also need good, clean paragraphs.
	- **[[Deconstruct, then reconstruct]]**
- You’ll see what you know and what you still need to know when trying to write clearly.
	- Clear writing pushes you to new areas of knowledge—clarity will clear a way for you.
		- [[3-1c2 Write down your problems |Write down your problems]], clearly.
