###### *On Writing Well*
- The medium of writing and reading changed. But [[1-2g2b Humans are significant insofar as we can create knowledge |nothing has replaced the writer]].
	- “Ultimately the product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is.”
- [[The essence of writing is rewriting]]
	- “Professional writers rewrite their sentences over and over and then rewrite what they have rewritten.”
- [[9-4c1 If you can't write about it, you can't code it. If you can't program it, you don't understand it. |Writing is coding]] acting on humans instead of machines
	- “Perhaps the writer has switched pronouns in midsentence, or has switched tenses, so the reader loses track of who is talking or when the action took place. Perhaps Sentence B is not a logical sequel to Sentence A; the writer, in whose head the connection is clear, hasn’t bothered to provide the missing link. Perhaps the writer has used a word incorrectly by not taking the trouble to look it up.
- The two most important qualities of good writing: humanity and warmth.
	- [[9-4b3e4 Write each sentence like you are talking to a friend |Write like you talk]]. Be yourself.
		- Personal anecdotes are warm, and easy to write with confidence. 
- Writers often don’t know what they are trying to say.
	- This is why I use [[3-1c3c00 Evergreen notes should be atomic |evergreen notes]] because it forces you to say something in one (or few) sentence(s).
- [[2-1a0a 'Occam's razor' & 'Irreducibility' - Simplify the problem but don't oversimplify. |Occam’s razor]] in writing—strip every sentence to its cleanest components.
	- “You have to strip your writing down before you can build it back up.”
		- It’s easier to make good argument with easy to understand sentences.
			- [[Deconstruct, then reconstruct]].
- [[7-1a Create something you would want for yourself, and never for some imaginary audience |Don’t address imaginary readers]]. Think about someone specific.
	- “I don’t want to meet “one”—he’s a boring guy.”
	- “We have become a society fearful of revealing who we are.”
	- “Leaders who bob and weave like aging boxers don’t inspire confidence—or deserve it. The same thing is true of writers.”
- [[4-1d0.2 Avoid the anonymous 'we' and 'they,' because they mask personal responsibility |Avoid the anonymous ‘one’]]—use ‘I’ and ‘me’ and ‘we’ and ‘us’ instead.
	- The technique also applies to negotiation. Check my note on [[4-1d0.1 The Pinocchio Effect - Liars use more words than truth tellers and use far more third-person pronouns |the Pinocchio Effect]].

###### Writing to Learn
- [[9-1b0c Reality doesn't differentiate reading-thinking-writing-playing-doing-investing-building |Writing is a form of thinking]]—those who think clearly can write as well as the best writer.
	- “Writing and thinking and learning were the same process.”
		- But writing is more physical than reading because you put your thoughts on paper—making it easier for you to see the gap between what you want to say and how you said it. That [[2-1a Information is in the difference. No difference, no information. 情報とは差異. 区別のないところに情報は生まれない. |difference is a useful piece of information]].
- Learning—[[2-1a4a Sometimes the best information is the least transmissible. |expect to find them in places where you least expect them to be]].
	- [[1-1c5 Surprises are the doors to revealing the inexplicit and the unconscious |Surprise is the key to learning]].
- [[3-1a The reality doesn’t have categories, there are only problems to be solved. Be problem-project-oriented. 'Academic subjects' are mere social constructs. |Knowledge is not compartmented]]—it’s all one house "and “writing is the key that opens the door."
- [[10-1b4a Learning is imitation and testing |Learn by imitation]]. Read your favorite writers, and study them.
- **[[The essence of writing is rewriting]]**.
	- Very few can say what they want to say on their first try.
		- It’s important to iterate—[[1-1a5b4.3 build-launch-measure-learn and iterate - don't restart |the same with startups]].
- You need good, clean sentences. But you also need good, clean paragraphs.
	- **[[Deconstruct, then reconstruct]]**
- You’ll see what you know and what you still need to know when trying to write clearly.
	- Clear writing pushes you to new areas of knowledge—clarity will clear a way for you.
		- [[3-1c2 Write down your problems |Write down your problems]], clearly.
