- [[3-1c2e3.1 It’s symbols all the way down]]
- [[10-2g1 Culture is an implicit theory for its members. It dictates what to look at and how they reason about the world.]]

- [[10-2g1f2a1 The question is what's the brain in NOT what’s in the brain]]

### Everett on other thinkers:
- [[1-1a2a3 Everett on Freud - No earlier theory made more lively use of the notion of innate, a priori dark matter]]
- [[1-1a2b Everett on Kant - His notion of categories is best translated into an inborn ability of humans to generalize and learn by any means. Humans are born to be learners. Individual humans have innate capacities to adjust to the world.]]
- [[1-1a2c Everett on Aristotle - He is responsible for the characterization of the mind as a blank slate ('Mind is in a sense potentially whatever is thinkable, though actually it is nothing until it has thought')]]
- [[9-2b3c1 Everett on Joseph Campbell's 'Monomyth' (innate content) - A tendency to think in generic terms of people and races is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological thinking. You could shape any myths into a monomyth if you so wished.]]
- [[9-2b3c2 Everett on Chomsky - UG (that humans are born with a tacit knowledge of many intricate details of grammar) and the idea that the linguistics capacity were identical and innate in all humans are 'monogrammar' similar to 'monomyth']]
	- [[10-2f1 Chomsky’s UG approach only looks at a subset (syntax) of a subset (language) of the whole (communication system — ‘the gestalt’). Syntax is only secondary to conversation.]]
- [[9-2b3d Everett on George Berkeley's critique of the very notions of abstraction and generalization - There is no mind of any kind, only bodies and the world in which they move]]
- [[9-2b3e Everett on John Locke - His tabula rasa didn’t mean there were no innate abilities, but that there were no innate specific concepts (innate capacities ≠ innate knowledge)]]
- [[9-2b3f Everett on Hume - Ideas only make sense or exist through experience]]
- [[10-2g1f2a3 Everett on Descartes - Dualism is one of the worst error ever introduced into philosophy, and simply ignores evolution]]
