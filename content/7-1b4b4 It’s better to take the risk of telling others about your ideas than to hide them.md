***[[7-1b4b5 Any kind of expertise is valuable, and some people will take unexpected action to capture that value such that it will be serendipitous to you]]***

- Ask: Are you an insurgent or an incumbent?
  - [[1-2f1b6 Volatility is good for insurgents (idiosyncratic disruptors) and bad for incumbents (legacy institutions)]]

- Knowledge is created individually. It can't be taken.
  - [[9-1b You can’t really transfer your knowledge to others, because each knowledge has to be created individually]]
  - [[9-1b0 Knowledge (both explicit and inexplicit) is created individually. You don’t say “I took it from him.” You can’t blame “he took it from me.”]]

- **[Why open source?]** 
    - Open sourcing project is probably more epistemologically correct. ***It’s about being honest with what knowledge is, and what it can and should be***. #develop 
        - You can’t really open source your mind (your originality and knowledge) anyways ([[9-1b0 Knowledge (both explicit and inexplicit) is created individually. You don’t say “I took it from him.” You can’t blame “he took it from me.”]])
            - [[9-1c2 You can only hope that people you care about will somewhat understand your explanations, but they will never understand you exhaustively]]
    - When you work with others but its relation is somewhat closed, you get L(PN). But when you literally open up yourself to random encounter, given that you don't get distracted from them, you might get L((PN)^2). The point is how to play with the relation between P and N, and explode your learning curve accordingly.
	    - *You can be the Infinite Learner L(N) (someone who doesn’t repeat the same mistakes) with a system like Second Brain, but you can also introduce another variable P and turn into the Networked Learner L(PN), or via ‘learn in public’ L((PN)^2)*
		    - L for learning, N years of experience, with P peers![[Pasted image 20240517084322.png]]
				- `P` is likely to grow with `N` as a function of your seniority and influence - making a good Networked Learner grow on the order of `L(N^2)` which is plenty great. But if you can figure out how to grow `P` superlinearly with `N` - by writing, speaking, teaching, etc - you can make your career explode in possibility.
					- I.e., **permeate multiversally instead of across in just one timeline**!
						- [[2-1b2c 'Compounding' - Permeate across the timeline]] + [[6-3b2c Composability with ownership means you can permeate across other possibilities]] = [[7-1b4b4b Permeate both across other possibilities in this universe and across multiversal timelines]]
    - In other words, ***[[7-1b4b4a Let knowledge permeate, and don’t force your constraints on them]]***. #categories 
      - [[7-1b4b4c Public Networked Learner must use composability with ownership and compounding to its advantage]]
    - Open source is about ideas of how to do things, and good writing is as good as good code
	    - [[9-4c2 'Programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.' 'Design to express algorithms, and only incidentally tell machines how to execute them.']]
		    - [[9-4c1 If you can't write about it, you can't code it. If you can't program it, you don't understand it.]]

- Let others know. They know better. 
  - Or more precisely, [[3-1c3c0 Ideas have timing]].
    - [[2-1c1 'Comparative advantage' - If others can do it, let them]]
      - And now you can own the consequences with blockchains 
				- [[6-3b2c Composability with ownership means you can permeate across other possibilities]]
					- And remember: [[6-3z A world without ownership is a world with less creativity and human flourishing]]
