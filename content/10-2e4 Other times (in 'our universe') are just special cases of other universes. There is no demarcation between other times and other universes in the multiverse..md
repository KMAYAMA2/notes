- [[1-2g2s5 When the instances are fungible, there is no such thing as 'which' - histories and individual particles are not perfectly partitioned into instances]]
- [[1-2g2t2 History (i.e., entangled) is information flow channel because it is approximately autonomous. That is to say, its entanglement means we can successfully predict some aspects of the future of that history from its past within that history.]]
- [[1-2g2t3 A history approximation breaks down when there is interference (i.e., merging), and histories do rejoin via interference phenomenon]]
- [[1-2g2s7d A history has to be explained in multiversal terms. The true explanation of what happened involves many other instances of me.]]

- [[10-2e4a There is no such thing as 'which half' would see 'heads', any more than there is an answer to the question 'which one am I']]
- [[10-2e5 The multiverse neither consists of a sequence of moments nor permits a flow of time.]]
