- [[RUL3 - Invert, always invert]]
- [[2-1b2b1 'Inversion' - Avoid stupid obvious bullshit you'd regret in the future]]
- [[5-2b1a2 When you invert, you are inverting the problem-situation itself (’why do I have this problem’)]]
- [[7-2a Be opportunistic and flexible globally rather than inverting locally and prematurely optimized]]
