- Seth Godin on Isaac Asimov: *“Here’s the secret.” He pointed to this old manual typewriter. He said, “Every morning, I sit in front of this typewriter at 7:00 am, and I type until noon. It doesn’t have to be good, but I have to keep typing.” If you know that tomorrow morning you have to start typing, tonight when you go to sleep or today when you’re walking around, you will be noticing things so that you have something to type. And I have enough in reserve that I don’t have to do it every day, but I do it every day because I eat lunch every day and because I take a shower every day.*
