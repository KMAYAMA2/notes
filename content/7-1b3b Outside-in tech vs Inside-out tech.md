- A lower bar for the fomer means the insiders will take them less seriously
  - Barriers to entry doesn't necessarily correlate to its importance!

- Native thinking (reads *novelty*) > Skeuomorphic thinking (reads *more of the same*)

- Today’s major technology movements involve sustaining technologies that look set to reinforce existing industry structures. 
  - AI ([[8-4 LLMs]]) and [[8-5 VR-AR]] are sustaining technologies
    - AI favors big companies with stockpiles of capital and data 
    - New devices like virtual reality headsets and self-driving cars require multibillion-dollar capital investments
  - Blockchains are the only credible counterweight to these centralizing forces

- Disruptive tech are harder to spot than sustaining ones, more so because media works with big tech companies - e.g., [[Know what to measure. Google Analytics is provided by Google. Know their incentives.]] Another reason why [[3-1c1d You must build your own media distribution to avoid distortion for yourself and others]] and to find crypto-native communities for quality information (e.g., Farcaster). Remember: [[3-1c1d1 Journalists distort our reality by 10,000x]].
  - iPhone was not sustaining tech because it disrupted the market for computers not just for phones (e.g., [[8-1c4a1 iPhone and texting (along with visual voicemail) boosted each other]])
