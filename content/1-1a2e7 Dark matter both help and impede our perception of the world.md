[[1-2a We perceive nothing as what it really is, but only virtually]]
[[3-1d1 We must start with our own peculiar constraints]]
[[3-1d6 Constraints in the form of consistent style leave space for creativity and progress]]

***[[1-1a2e7b You need some form of constraints to see anything]]:***
	[[10-2d1 The laws of physics are not necessarily to be expressed with current notation. The relation is arbitrary.]]
		[[2-1b2f 'Equivalence' - Reality doesn't care genealogy. Solving problems is what matters. How it's done matters less.]]
		[[10-2g2c1a Universality of symbols - if one specie can manipulate symbols, then that species can understand any other species who also use symbols]]
		[[10-2d1a The regularity in nature can be expressed arbitrarily well either by the language of mathematics, natural language, or by computers (zeros and ones)]]
	[[3-1a0 Use categories, but don't be categorized]]
		[[3-1a The reality doesn’t have categories, there are only problems to be solved. Be problem-project-oriented. 'Academic subjects' are mere social constructs.]]
	Put differently: **[[1-1a2e7c You can't help being cultural, but you don't have to commit to any specific culture]]**
		[[10-2g3e We are, and will be, transitioning from anti-rational memes to rational memes]]
		Somewhat crazy connection:
			[[7-1c You are not committed to any specific problem. You are committed to figuring out something no one knew before. You are committed to the unpredictable.]]
				[[9-4b2b1a We are free insofar as we can create knowledge]]

*[[1-1a2e8a We see symbolically and not otherwise]]:*
- Dark matter both help and impede our perception of the world
	- We "put things together" to form our gestalt
		- This connecting dots = 'Emic vision'
			***[[1-1a2e7a Apperceptions = The ways by which we process, make sense of, and assimilate our experiences]]***
			- [[1-1a2e9b When 'properly' emicized by the culture, we see what's not there and can not see what's there]]
				[[10-1b2a Emicization = The construction of an insider point of view (the 'dark matter')]]
				[[3-1c1b You are what you think and you think what you see, and you see what you think]]
					[[2-1a2 See clearly - 解像度を高める]]
					[[2-1b Seeing the unseen (面影・うつろい)]]
					[[10-2g2e6 Abstraction is the unseen]]
					[[5-1b4b Compounding is usually too slow to notice. You have to be deliberate in how you think and what you see.]]
					[[2-1a1a9a Survivorship bias + Incentives = We can't see what can be seen and see what's not even there]]
					[[7-1a6a Successful founders see different problems]]
					[[1-2g1c Memes beat genes. We will see what cannot be seen with new knowledge and new technology.]]
					[[1-1c You need the best available epistemology because it affects how you see the world]] 
						*Epistemology is technology, in a sense*
- ***[[1-1a2e8 'Seeing' really occurs after going through (or together with) emicization]]***
	- Even for basic perception as seeing one cannot do without culture. There is no purely etic vision, because seeing only the etic literally means nothing as a recognition. 
		[[1-1a2e7d 文化とは生きること・生きることは情報文化にかかわること]]
		[[1-2a1 Our ‘direct’ experience is also virtual because its meaning is conjectured and interpreted via guesses]]
			[[10-2g1 Culture is an implicit theory for its members. It dictates what to look at and how they reason about the world.]]
				[[1-1a2e9 Emic vision = Interpreting what you are seeing as symbols]]
