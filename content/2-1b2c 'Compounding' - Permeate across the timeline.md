- [[3-1c3b1 You don’t take notes to know where the knowledge came from (justification), but to use it in the future, to solve problems.]]
- [[9-2a1 It doesn’t matter where you came from (or where you are); what matters is what you can do and where you are going]]
- [[5-1b4b1 Life’s evolution’s superpower is its time horizon. 3.8 billion years of miniscule changes compounded.]]


- [[2-1b2d 'Trust' - The most effective business is one with trust. Build one.]]

- [[1-1a4c If you assume the possible existence of the ‘ultimate’ theory, you’d be assuming a meaningless (zero-freedom) world]]
- [[2-1a7b Work in a field you have both a natural aptitude for and deep interest in. It should become increasingly interesting as you learn more about it.]]

		- [[RUL3 - Invert, always invert]]
	- [[3-1d Consistency requires consistent constraints]]
	- [[3-1d6c Amara’s law modified - we underestimate the importance of consistency in the short-run, but overestimate in the long-run]]
	- [[5-1b4c Exponential growth feels flat in the beginning, precisely why it’s worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. You can also follow the Fun Criterion (the latter likely exhausts the former). Consistency is the key.]]

**It is the formula for both success and failure:**
- [[5-1b4b Compounding is usually too slow to notice. You have to be deliberate in how you think and what you see.]]
- [[5-2b0 You are what you do repeatedly]]
	- [[6-2a Addiction lessens one’s ability to experience joy in life.]]
- [[3-1c1d0 We are overconsuming novelty (and “serendipity”) and under-consuming purpose. The first thing to look at each day should be your purpose and metrics to improve upon, not some random stories.]]
- [[5-2b Errors of omission are dangerous because you make them by default]]

- [[AN3C - Piraha doesn’t differentiate the future and the past]]
- The multiverse doesn't differentiate the future from the past (nor *this universe* from *that universe*)
	- [[10-2e2 The multiverse does not ‘come into existence’ or ‘cease to exist’; those terms presuppose the flow of time. It is only imagining the flow of time that makes us wonder what happened ‘before’ or ‘after’ the whole of reality.]]
	- [[10-2e4 Other times (in 'our universe') are just special cases of other universes. There is no demarcation between other times and other universes in the multiverse.]]
	- [[10-2e9 Variants do exist in the multiverse - not in the past or in the future, but they literally do exist somewhere in the multiverse!]]
