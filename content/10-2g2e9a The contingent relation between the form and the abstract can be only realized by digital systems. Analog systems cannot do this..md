- The multiverse is digital, in the sense how each universe in the multiverse exists arbitrarily (i.e., my universe could've existed otherwise). Conceptualizing only one universe amounts to being analog.
- [[1-2g2t3e Other life-forms can't permeate across the multiverse because biological knowledge is primarily about the surrounding environment and its correspondence within THAT universe, and the latter is subject to 'randomness']]
