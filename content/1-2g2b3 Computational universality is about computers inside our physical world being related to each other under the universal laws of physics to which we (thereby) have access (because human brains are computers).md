- [[1-2g2h Life is associated with a fundamental principle of physics – the Turing principle – since it is the means by which virtual reality was first realized in nature. (Life = physical embodiment of knowledge = the Turing principle)]]
- [[1-2g2n The Turing principle is an apparent fact, and we are trying to explain that fact, to place it within the same framework as other facts we know]]

- [[1-2g2b3a Both Great Simulator and all-possible-computer-programs-are-running arguments are bad explanations because computation doesn't precede physical world and its laws.]]
- [[1-2g2b4 The universality of computation is a property of hardware and rather uncontroversial. The universality of explanation is a property of software and rather controversial.]]
