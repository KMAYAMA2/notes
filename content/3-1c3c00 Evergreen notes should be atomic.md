	- Atomic notes are bottom-up via links:

			- I use a mostly folderless method. I don't organize things top-down. **I let Obsidian organize things for me, bottom-up, from the links in my notes.** I do have a few folders for admin files that I don't want cluttering the nav, namely: attachments, clippings, daily notes, external references. I use templates very heavily to make sure each note type links to the relevant category. I use links very heavily, for proper nouns, names, places, concepts, etc. Even if I don't create the note immediately. Most of my notetaking is atomic journal-type entries (like zettelkasten). Some are synthesized into evergreen notes. I am consistent about reviewing and summarizing my thoughts about once a week and every 6 months.
