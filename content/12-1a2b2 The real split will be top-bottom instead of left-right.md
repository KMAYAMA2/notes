Again, remember the interoperability between left and right: 
	[[4-1a4b2b2 History repeats and reverses]]
		[[12-1a2b3 Left eventually becomes the right, not ideologically but economically and systematically]]

Blue vs red to dollar-green vs BTC-orange with BTC yellow splashed all over political spectrum. **From right-left to top-bottom**.
- The fight won't be simple as Barbara Walter imagines (freedom-benevolent-diversity vs neo-Nazism) but more complicated. The real split will be the following. It won't be 99/1 split but 50/50, and that maximizes conflict.

		*From red-vs-blue to orange-vs-green. 
		Decentralized network vs centralized state. 
		Internationalists and capitalists vs nationalists and socialists. 
		The cloud vs the land. 
		And Bitcoin vs the dollar.*
	- Dollar Green - Republicans, state people, military, neo-conservatives, US flag over anything people, authoritarian #develop 
	- BTC Orange - Democrats, tech founders, anti-Trump, libertarian, non-whites (because inflation hits hard there: Jack Dorsey's coin usage is high in third-world) #develop 
		[[6-3b2.5 India (or any other country-company-community) can act as the tech-media superpower of de-Americanization-dollarization movement]]
- Coins on exchanges will be seized by CEX
	- Maximalists can introduce amendments to BTC. That is, they can allow seizure of BTC by CEX. 
		- [[6-3a2 How you have something can (and will) matter more than what (you think) you have (e.g., DEX vs CEX - DEX will counter Maximalists movement)]]
		[[6-3b3f2 BTC Maximalists are monotheists and political network]]
		- Remember what's happening to free speech in the US.

[[6-3b2.4b Politics was (about) social media (2010s) and will be (about) cryptocurrency (2020s)]]
	[[8-1b3 The software can control the hardware]]
- Politics was about whereabouts of server that hosts Trump's Twitter account
- Politics will be about where the money is located (i.e., whether seizure resistant or not)
