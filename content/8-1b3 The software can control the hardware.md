    - Traditional computer: the hardware controls the software
    - Blockchains: the software is in charge
      - [[8-1b3a A blockchain takes the code seriously]]

- [[8-1b3b When software is in charge, designers can take full advantage of the expressivity of software]]
  - [[12-1d Flexible media will surface contingency]]
    - [[8-1b3c Software is a highly plastic flexible medium and almost any economic model that can be dreamed up can be implemented in software]]
      - [[8-1b3f A blockchain economy must balance the supply ('faucets') and demand ('sinks') of native tokens to fuel sustainable growth]]
				- [[8-1b3d Monetary policies can come first and the currency circulation can come later (or symbiotically-simultaneously), not vice versa (i.e., bottom-up vs top-down)]]
  - Blockchain architecture itself is a software that did away with the hardware #develop 
    - In a way blockchains are killer-app because you don't really have to worry about the hardware infrastructure
      - [[8-1c4 ‘Killer application’ is knowledge-technology-universality that begets reflexivity between app-platform-people by pushing people over the threshold]]
				- [[8-2b2b Key moment is when people (e.g., devs) don't have to worry about the infrastructure (e.g., platform risks including high take rates)]]
    - I.e., substrate-independent
      - [[5-1b1a1c1 The interoperability law - information can be copied from any system that can embody information to any other such system, irrespective of the details (i.e., substrate-independent)]]
  - Designers don't need to worry about nodes turning evil 
    - Can't be evil > Don't be evil
      - [[2-1a0c1f The network won't let anyone (particularly the state) coerce]]
				- [[7-1b4b1 Technical truth ≠ Political truth]]
    - They can focus more on the designing per se [Creativity per se]
      - [[8-1c2a What matters is the creativity per se, because non-creative parts will be made easier]]
    - The job of the founding team is to design the core software for the network and an incentive system that encourages growth 
      - ***Structuring incentives comes first in the designing***, because if it's poorly designed no one will join such network!
				- [[2-1b2b1a Get your incentives right from the beginning]]
				- [[2-1a6 'Incentives' - Incentives drive (almost) everything. Understand your incentives.]]
				- [[2-1a6a Understanding incentives amounts to understanding its culture]]

- [[8-1c2 Robotics then software (likely in that order, although not necessarily) will replace Uber, Amazon, Doordash]]
  - [[8-1c1 Potential scenario - Digital frontend + Human backend ⇒ Digital frontend + Digital backend]]
