- Self = A memory of _skandhas_
    - In Buddhism there is _anatman_, “no-self,” meaning that there is no essence of an individual human, just the set of experiences they pass through, **their apperceptive histories** (or in Buddhist terms, the _skandhas_: form, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness).
        - How we come to have taste experiences and how these ultimately give us our sense of what we like to eat, contributing to our very sense of “self” and personality illustrates Everett’s point
            - Buddhism = Everett = Hume
                - Self = A sequence of experiences
                    - “A recursive definition of the self”
