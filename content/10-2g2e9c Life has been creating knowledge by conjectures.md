- [[10-2f2a Explanation regarding any evolution must take knowledge into account]]
---
- [[1-2g2c Knowledge must be first conjectured (i.e., created) and then tested. That’s what life has been doing all along, according to Darwin’s theory. It can’t be derived mechanically (Lamarckism is wrong).]]
---
- [[10-2g2e9d There are no 'species' in nature. Reality doesn't distinguish life by categories.]]
---
**Our 'life' is different from other species:**
- [[9-4b2a1 Most of the evolution happened inside human brains]]
- [[9-4b2a Writing is THE evolution. It’s more fast-universal-explicit in contrast to the evolution of genes.]]
- [[9-4b2d The evolution of ideas is defined by ‘jumps’ via creative mutations]]
- [[9-4b2b The evolution of ideas (memes) is somewhat intentional, whereas that of genes are random AND cannot be rejected]]
- [[3-1c3c Keep each ideas separately, because there is nothing absolute and necessary in the connections I make between them]]
- [[9-4b2c You can host multiple memes both consequentially or simultaneously during your lifetime. A gene in contrast can be hosted only once per life-cycle.]]
- [[1-2g2b Humans are significant insofar as we can create knowledge]]
- In other words, non-humans are insignificant because they cannot create knowledge individually.
