[[3-1c3c3a1 Don't be so attached to anything because almost everything is contingent. Assume no self.]] [[3-1c3c3a2 More precisely, almost everything CAN BE made contingent]] and that's the essence of *digitization*.

Nothing is necessary means possible configurations are infinite. See [[10-2g2c1 Symbols are universal. Being arbitrary and contingent means it can represent anything, and do everything.]]

##### Things made contingent in other notes:
- [[1-1a2a There is no human nature if by this we mean a kind of a priori knowledge common to all and only to humans]]
- [[1-1a2e10 There is no such thing as objective meaning]]
- [[1-2g2t5a There is no such thing as the 'same' instance of a particle at different times - i.e., there is no such thing as speed of 'one instance' in the quantum physics (Heisenberg uncertainty principle)]]
- [[2-1a6b 'Pavlovian association' & 'Social proof' - Understand the arbitrary association formed within your culture. There are no pure indexes for humans.]]
- [[3-1c2e0 There is no minimum idea]]
- [[3-1d4 There are no perfect tools, just as there are no ultimate problems]]
- [[6-3b3.1 There is no necessary incentive (i.e., norm incentives)]]
- [[6-7b Nutrition doesn’t exist independently from the patient]]
- [[9-2b2 There is no objective hierarchy amongst knowledge; only cultural-subjective hierarchy exists because we are cultural being (知識・情報そのものに優劣はない)]]
- [[9-2b3a There is no universal culture, because culture is contingency (文化 = 上澄み)]]
- [[9-2b3d Everett on George Berkeley's critique of the very notions of abstraction and generalization - There is no mind of any kind, only bodies and the world in which they move]]
- [[9-2b3e2 There is no universal symbol-idea (in the sense of capable of conveying universal meaning)]]
- [[9-2b3e3 There is no universal knowledge]]
- [[9-2b3e3.1 Maybe there is no abstract universality, just less locality]]
- [[10-2g2c0b There is no a priori - 直観は存在しない]]
- [[11-3.5 There is no universal utility. Utility doesn't exist in the abstract, it must be rooted in the context and corresponding explanations.]]
