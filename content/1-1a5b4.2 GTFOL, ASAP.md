*Get the f--- off local host, as soon as possible*. Ideas must be tested with real users as quickly as possible through constant deployment and experimentation. [[4-1a3a Imaginary problems lead to imaginary feedback, and that's not feedback]]. Building in public usually gets you the first two of [[6-3b2e Network effects + Feedback loops + Composability = Exponential growth]].

Masahiro Sakurai, a creator of Super Smash Bros, also emphasized the importance of nudging players to play hit that **RETRY** button as soon as possible ([[9-4b3e3d リトライの操作を迅速にすること・させること]]).
