    - _A suggested methodology for establishing culture-grammar connections_
    - _That Piraha is not a unique case and that **[[10-1b8 All languages will show culture-language connections if we look for it]]**!_

    - The biggest lacuna in the study of ethnogrammar
        - The effect of values, especially cultural **taboos**, in restricting both culture and grammar!
    - **[[10-1b9 Ethnogrammatical studies are to explain the linkage between nonlinguistic evidence and noncultural evidence]]**
        - **To explain how linking the two provides a conceptually and empirically superior account of the facts that leave them unconnected**
