- [[1-2f1b1 Digital system is composable]]
	- [[8-1b3c Software is a highly plastic flexible medium and almost any economic model that can be dreamed up can be implemented in software]]
		- [[8-1a What can go digital will go digital]]
			- [[3-1d4b1 What’s been considered ‘analog’ must be represented digitally, because the distinction is rather arbitrary]]

- Because software is a flexible medium, it allows new relation to be formed between ideology and economic models:
	- [[8-1b3d Monetary policies can come first and the currency circulation can come later (or symbiotically-simultaneously), not vice versa (i.e., bottom-up vs top-down)]]
		- [[8-1b3 The software can control the hardware]]
			- [[12-1a2d Abstractions such as 'the economy' and 'the supply chain' can be realized arbitrarily well (never exhaustively)]]

- And in the case of blockchain networks the ideology is immutable!
	- [[8-1b3a A blockchain takes the code seriously]]

- [[8-1b3f A blockchain economy must balance the supply ('faucets') and demand ('sinks') of native tokens to fuel sustainable growth]]
