title: About this project
---
I started taking these notes as a way to clear my head. The cognitive offload was huge and it surely felt like going through meditation 2.0. But the whole process of writing them down resulted in more ideas being generated, with writing these down also begetting more ideas, ad infinitum. Although [[4-1a4b6a1 Future self is enough of an audience]], I'm making these notes public because [[8-2d1b Forwardable insights can lead to network effects]] and because I believe that [[6-3b2e Network effects + Feedback loops + Composability = Exponential growth]].
##### Some good starting points if you are interested in any of these fields (although [[3-1a The reality doesn’t have categories, there are only problems to be solved. Be problem-project-oriented. 'Academic subjects' are mere social constructs.]]):
- Philosophy (epistemology)
  - [[5-2 What counts cannot be counted]]
  - [[5-1b1a2c0 No theory can exhaust reality]]
  - [[1-1c4b You always have to solve problems, including the problem of what problems to solve]]
  - [[12-1e Nothing is necessary = Everything is contingent]]
- History
  - [[4-1a4b2b2 History repeats and reverses]]
  - [[9-4b2a1d A group of people who doesn't know who they are and where they came from won't make it to the moon or Mars]]
  - [[4-1a4b2b1 'One-of-those' over one-off - Learn from history (not just from your 'own' experience)]]
- Tech
  - [[7-1b4f Let the tech decide where to go (both intellectually and physically)]]
  - [[7-1d2a The relation between technology and the problem-situation (i.e., culture and mind) is reflexive]]
- Evolution
  - [[5-1b4b1 Life’s evolution’s superpower is its time horizon. 3.8 billion years of miniscule changes compounded.]]
  - [[10-2d2e9e Evolution of 'other life-forms' must evoke the influence of human existence]]
  - [[2-1a5a Evolution doesn't care about lifetime of each individual gene-meme carrier (its sample is beyond your own experience and any human lifetime)]]
- Information
  - [[5-1b1a2c0.1 Perfect replication is impossible]]
  - [[2-1a 情報とは差異 (= manifestation of contingency)。区別のないところに情報は生まれない。]]
- Semiotics
  - [[10-2g2c1 Symbols are universal. Being arbitrary and contingent means it can represent anything, and do everything.]]
  - [[3-1c2e3 Infinite semiosis - 'There is no beginning or end to symbols because it is recursive']]
- Negotiation
  - [[4-1d0 Look at the whole of conversations, including how things are being said as well as what’s not being said (e.g., taboos)]]
- Culture
  - [[10-2g1 Culture is an implicit theory for its members. It dictates what to look at and how they reason about the world.]]
  - [[10-2g1f2a1 The question is what's the brain in NOT what’s in the brain]]
  - [[9-4b2a1e 外部性・外来性を重視すること]]
- Media
  - [[3-1c1b You are what you think and you think what you see, and you see what you think]]
  - [[9-2b1.2 Marshall McLuhan - 'It is the medium itself that is the message, not the content']]
- Language
  - [[2-1a4 'Language instinct' - Language can't exhaust mind]]
  - [[1-1a2e4 Cultures precede languages]]
- Productivity
  - [[3-1d6 Constraints in the form of consistent style leave space for creativity and progress]][[5-1b4c1b You can easily replace the self-discipline with the four laws of habit formation - (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying]]
- Life
  - [[3-1b2 Use the Fun Criterion to filter what problems to work on]]
  - [[RUL3 - Love bad news. Always question to falsify your idea and theory. Invalidate ASAP. How fast you can invalidate matters as much as how fast you can build them. Rule out bad explanations.]]
- Investing
  - [[11-1b Investment is expression and you need methods and techniques (i.e., knowledge)]]
  - [[4-1a4b6a0.2 Money is our time and energy in an abstracted form]]
- Blockchain
  - [[6-3b1 Users become owners with tokens]]
  - [[6-3b When you own something, you have an incentive to invest in it]]
  - [[8-1b3 The software can control the hardware]]
- Longevity
  - [[6-1b You either have to realign the incentives of capitalist entities you are outsourcing your health, or you have to take care of yourself]]

##### Why all these 'atomic' notes instead of blog posts?
- [[3-1c3c Keep each ideas separately, because there is nothing absolute and necessary in the connections I make between them]]
- [[12-1e Nothing is necessary = Everything is contingent]]
- [[3-1c2e 情報は関係性の中にある - Meaning is often in relation to other things]]
- [[3-1c2e1 Connecting-relating ideas is a way of creating knowledge]]
- [[3-1c2e0 There is no minimum idea]]
