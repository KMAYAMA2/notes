“Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity” – Seneca

- **Four Kinds of Luck** (inspired by [swyx](https://www.swyx.io/create-luck#four-kinds-of-luck))
    1. You just get lucky.
        - **Accidental Luck**: $100 on the street.
    2. Hustle until you stumble.
        - **Active Luck**: Winning a lottery. At least you bought the ticket yourself.
    3. “Chance favors the prepared mind.”
        - **Prepared Luck**: The luck you get from noticing that something lucky has happened, that most would miss. Where they see miracle, you see luck.
	        - The canonical story on this is Alexander Fleming’s discovery of penicillin, which was a huge medical breakthrough. The discovery was a total accident (some mold happened to fall in the right spot + Fleming happened to see it + he had a similar experience that was a nonevent 9 years ago), but Fleming was not only “uniquely equipped to observe it” by his background, he took action to confirm the observation.
            > “Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to [[3-1c Know what your problems are |keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind]], although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. [[RUL3 - Ask at night how what you’ve learned that day fits into your web of ideas, and search for overlaps and contradictions. Most people do not do this. |Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps]]. Every once in a while [[3-1c3c0 Ideas have timing |there will be a hit]], and people will say: “How did he do it? He must be a genius!”” - Gian-Carlo Rota
    4. Luck finds you. [[5-1b1b1 Become good at multiple things rather than being super good at one specific thing (the former is both easier and effective) |Become the best at what you do]]. Refine what you do until this is true. People will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny. 
        - **Magnetic Luck**: Chance IV comes to you, unsought, [[5-1b1b3 Productize yourself (as an embodiment of reality) |because of who you are and how you behave]].
