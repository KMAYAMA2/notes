[[10-1b5 We enter the world of language-based learning once we have mastered a language]], but learning starts way before language acquisition. [[10-1b4 Children concentrically embody their ever-widening knowledge structures by testing the degree of its correspondence in comparison with other members of the society]] 
- [[3-1b1b1 No learning without doing; specifically, no learning without cultural doing]]
- [[10-1b6 Culture ⇒ Culturally invented symbols ⇒ Language (Culture invents things. Everyone is part of a culture. Every individual learning take place within culture. Every invention is built up over time, including language.)]]


In other words, language can't exhaust culture. [[2-1a4 'Language instinct' - Language can't exhaust mind]]. And understanding language comprehensively means understanding its culture, because [[10-1b8 All languages will show culture-language connections if we look for it]]

[[1-1a2e4a 言い換え = Making sense in your own world, that is, in your own language and in your own web of ideas]]
