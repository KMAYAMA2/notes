You should cast a net to [[9-3 Increase surface area of luck |get lucky]], but [[RUL3 - Bounded commitment - choose one best thing available, commit for predetermined time period, then revisit. Similar to balancing depth-first vs breadth-first in search algorithms. Think of your time as quantifiable resource like capital. |time is limited]]—so be mindful where you cast your net. And [[5-1b1b1a1a Pareto principle (or law of the vital few) - 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes |you don’t have to catch everything]]. Just catch [[5-1b1b1a1b Not every relationships matter. Most likely, only a few matter. |a few that matters]].

Be specific. 
[[4-1a3b Go to specific places to get specific feedbacks]]
[[6-3d Be very specific about problems and divide a project clear cut so it doesn't become bleak, like shared common room.]]
[[9-4b2a1c The moment you write about any societal problem in depth you'll find yourself writing a history of that problem]]

[[William Zinsser]]: “*Decide what corner of your subject you’re going to bite off, and be content and cover it well and stop.*”

This is a inverted version of [[2-1b3a 'Circle of competence' & 'Niches' - Build a moat. Thrive in where you can. |“build a moat—thrive in where you can”]] mental model of Warren Buffet.
