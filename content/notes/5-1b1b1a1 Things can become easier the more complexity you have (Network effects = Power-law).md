- A key challenge when building networks is overcoming the “bootstrap” or “cold start” problem: attracting users and contributors before enough of them are participating to make the network intrinsically useful.
	- Network effects cut both ways: they can accelerate growth, but they can also handicap it. Scaled networks attract new users without much effort. Conversely, subscale networks struggle just to survive.

- L1s - BTC and ETH are already that vital few with network effects already kicked in
	- The next frontier is L2s ([[8-2b2d Value shifts to adjacent layers]])
