[[AN3C - It took Darwin a book to explain his theory but now it can be summarized into a paragraph]]

Learning human languages consists of constantly conjecturing-guessing the meaning of the words being used, both within the context of what can be seen (what's been written-spoken) along with what can't be seen (whole context considered - what can't be spoken-written, i.e., understanding its culture). Both the seen and the unseen have meaning. That is, both are symbols (*symbols all the way down*). Learning human languages thus comes down to understanding symbolic relation between everything including what can and cannot be seen *with explanations*. 
[[10-2g3a Everything is (or more precisely, became) symbol. Social values-knowledge-structures themselves are symbols represented by non-explicit forms (e.g., traditions and habits) interpreted non-explicitly ('流れ込む情報').]]

**Meaning:**
[[10-2f3a2 There can only be enough overlap of meanings between any entities (e.g., individual, group, society, theory, reality) — ‘ゆらぎ’]]
[[1-1a4c If you assume the possible existence of the ‘ultimate’ theory, you’d be assuming a meaningless (zero-freedom) world]]
[[1-2a1 Our ‘direct’ experience is also virtual because its meaning is conjectured and interpreted via guesses]]
[[10-2g3d Behaviors can be replicators even when its meanings are not (properly) understood, because we can guess the meaning of memes. For rational memes, knowledge is THE replicator.]]
