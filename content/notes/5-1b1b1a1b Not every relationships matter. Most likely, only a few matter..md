[[7-1a2a1 絶対に勝てるところから勝っていく]]
[[2-1b3a 'Circle of competence' & 'Niches' - Build a moat. Thrive in where you can.]]

[[4-1a4b2d 'Tendency to want to do something' (e.g., fight, flight, intervention, demonstration of value) - We don't get paid for activity, just for being right. The big money is in the waiting. Look for a fat pitch.]]

	And remember [[3-1c1d0a Zipf’s law distribution = Passive consumption make up 99% of activities on the internet, and less than 1% even comment on content, and much less than THAT actually create something new]]
		In short, put yourself out there!
