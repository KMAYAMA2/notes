[[6-1b You either have to realign the incentives of capitalist entities you are outsourcing your health, or you have to take care of yourself |Why are we outsourcing our health?]] We don’t even own our bodies anymore?

[[2-1a6 'Incentives' - Incentives drive (almost) everything. Understand your incentives.]]
	[[2-1b2b1a Get your incentives right from the beginning]]
		[[8-1b3d Monetary policies can come first and the currency circulation can come later (or symbiotically-simultaneously), not vice versa (i.e., bottom-up vs top-down)]]

***Don't externalize incentives***:
- [[3-1c1d You must build your own media distribution to avoid distortion for yourself and others]]
	- [[6-1a We are outsourcing to capitalist entities who are not aligned with us]]
- *You can tax them, or creatively destruct them by building digital native (i.e., tech-based) communities that are much less prone to externalized incentives*:
	- [[2-2c1 If you have negative externalities, tax it]]
	- [[2-1a0 'Creative destruction' - Think outside the box. Evolution of ideas must be revolutionary. Knowledge creation involves rebellion against current explanatory framework.]]
- [[6-3b3d Externalized incentives (negative externalities) go away when everything is externalized]]
	- Remember: [[RUL3 - Invert, always invert]]

***Own your own***:
- **[[6-3a Ownership is not just about physical-digital asset, but about yourself]]**
	- [[6-3a1 You have to own your own creation. The difference between creator and influencer is the gap of digital property rights.]]
		- Similar to the difference between sales and PMs? #develop 

***Digital ownership***: 
- You should own digitally (digital-physical demarcation is arbitrary after all!) and there should be property rights equivalent in the real of digital #categories 
	- [[8-1b2 Digital-physical is entwined]]
		- Own and help own
			- Why newsletter is having a renaissance (e.g., Substack)
				- Email list is generally better, because amount of crap you get is much less compared to Hacker News
					- This could be because both creators and users use their own email address in the former, whereas in the latter users don't really own their identities there #develop 
						- The same applies to X
							- The case for Web3 social #develop 

***[[6-3b0 When you own something, you can do whatever with it]]***
***[[6-3b1 Users become owners with tokens]]***
***[[6-3c When you are invested, you'll try to own it]]***
***[[6-3d Be very specific about problems and divide a project clear cut so it doesn't become bleak, like shared common room.]]***

E.g., my Obsidian notes and baseball gloves
- [[5-2c2b1a If you want your writing to still be readable on a computer from the 2060s or 2160s, it’s important that your notes can be read on a computer from the 1960s, for your future self]]

Crazy connection:
- [[5-1b4c2a When you have an agency, you don't get depleted. We aren't powered by a battery.]]
