First of all, not many people build. Remember [[3-1c1d0a Zipf’s law distribution = Passive consumption make up 99% of activities on the internet, and less than 1% even comment on content, and much less than THAT actually create something new]].

Make something, show it to others (really just showing), analyze analytically vs emotionally (don’t get too attached because [[9-4b2a1d0.3 The essence of analysis is articulation - 分析の本質は分節]]), and get feedback.

Even for those rare people who actually build stuff, most of them get stuck on the creation part. But you have to go through the whole build-launch-measure-learn loop and repeat that process (i.e., iterate). Don't get stuck inside the loop. You have to iterate before pivot. You have to learn from your own creation by asking from your fans on what to create/add next, and use that insight for your next loop.

When you invert this, it also means that you should ***[[1-1a5b4.3a Pick iterable projects (for you)]]*** ([[RUL3 - Invert, always invert]]).

Building something is a skill, but learning from users is a whole another set of skills. Usually, the former is project-specific, but the latter is more general. You will benefit immensely if you know how to get feedback from users, no matter what you build. Remember that [[5-1b1a3 We are more than technology, because we create knowledge-technology. We are more than functions. Don’t be a function.]] Tl;dr - the ability to learn from users compounds because it's not project-specific. [[6-3b2a Interoperability implies compounding]], and compounding is a superpower! ([[2-1b2c 'Compounding' - Permeate across the timeline]])

It means we should [[9-4b3e3b Emphasize ease of use over perfection. Embrace iterative minimalism.]] Put differently, [[1-1a5b5 Shipping perfection means you are too late - you have to find a balance of finding the right moment and being fixable]]

Paul Graham says similar things about writing, that you should [[9-4b3a Write a bad version 1.0 as fast as you can]].

[[7-1a1a1 Imaginary problems lead to ‘investment’ and ‘work’ - don't indulge with them]]

How to get feedbacks (from The Mom Test):
- [[4-1c1 Don’t prematurely zoom in during conversation, because he might not be self-conscious of the real problems]]
	- [[4-1d4 Listening is the most effective way to pay respect, and it's free]]
- [[7-1b2a Arbitrage what’s been said vs what’s been bought]]
	- [[7-1b2b1 The best is seeing the front by yourself, because inexplicit and unconscious ideas exist between heads not within them]]
	- Learn from what people already do instead of what they say 
	    - Bad questions:
	        - **Basically leading questions (they are with assumptions)**
	            - “How do you like it?” (e.g., restaurant)
	            - “What do you think about my idea?”
	            - “Would you use my app everyday?”
	            - “Feature request?”
	            - “Would you pay money for this?”
	    - Better questions:
	        - **Make it about their life, not your project. Ask about their habits/experience to gain insight on how to improve your own idea**
	            - “What does the taste reminds you of?” (e.g., restaurant)
	            - “What do you like about it, what you don't like about it?” (e.g., restaurant)
	            - “Why signed up?”
	            - “What apps do you use everyday? Why?”
	            - “What do  you use already? What stands out about them?”
	            - “This costs $9 - do you want to pay ***now***?”
	            - “Do you pay something like this ***right now***?”
