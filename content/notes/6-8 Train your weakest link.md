Jerzy Gregorek says it’s usually one organ that causes all the others to fail. 

And he relates this to joints. Your weightlifting performance (e.g., squat) can improve a lot, for example, by addressing the mobility of ankles—just by few degrees.

Fix your weakest link.

**Interesting Research:**
- Dr. Winsor’s autopsies (a series of studies conducted by Dr. Henry Winsor in the 1920s)
	- Rather than disproving chiropractic theory, it ended up reinforcing the idea that there is a connection between spinal health and overall body function, including organ health. His findings suggest that degeneration in the spine can correspond to degeneration in organs controlled by nerves at the same spinal level, highlighting the importance of spinal alignment in maintaining good health.
