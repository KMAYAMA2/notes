I've recently learned that it's almost necessary to [[3-1c2 Write down your problems]] but writing down is not sufficient in establishing new habits (or fixing old habits). Writing down makes it obvious but you really have to make it attractive, easy, and satisfying as well.

I have *my-stupid-decisions folder* and I take notes in it whenever I make, well, stupid decisions. But my girlfriend tells me, *"What's the point of taking note if you are not doing anything about it!?"* And I'm like that's right.

For example, I tend to pick tank tops for my pajama and wake up cold. So I told her how I should probably put a note in the bedroom saying "*Don't go to bet with tank tops.*" But she told me that wouldn't help. Better idea is to buy nice pajamas, and place them on the bed everyday. 

1. **Make it obvious-visible**: [[5-2a2 What gets measured gets managed]]. Understand the context wherein your certain habit is triggered, and make that causation as clear as possible. Remember swimming and biking feedback analogy, of how *the water can literally dampen the feedback.* You can easily tell if you suck at riding, but less so for swimming.
2. **Make it attractive**: [[2-1a1a3c Belong where your desired habits are the norm]]! Related mental models are [[2-1a6b 'Pavlovian association' & 'Social proof' - Understand the arbitrary association formed within your culture. There are no pure indexes for humans.]]
3. **Make it easy**: follow **[[9-4b3e3f The Two-Minute Rule - 'When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do']]**. It's similar to how [[9-4b3e3a Interfaces should follow the principle of least astonishment]]. Related mental model is [[2-1a6 'Incentives' - Incentives drive (almost) everything. Understand your incentives.]] [[2-1b2b1a Get your incentives right from the beginning]].
4. **Make it satisfying**: *[[5-1b4c1c Align your short-term reward with your long-term vision]]*. Related mental model is [[2-1b2c 'Compounding' - Permeate across the timeline]].

[[RUL3 - Ask 'what would it look like if it were easy and fun']] instead of figuring out how to be self-disciplined.
