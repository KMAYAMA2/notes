I've learned it's necessary to [[3-1c2 Write down your problems |write down your problems]] but that is not sufficient in establishing new habits (and fixing old habits). It makes it obvious but you have to make it attractive, easy, and satisfying as well. [[2-1b2c1 Knowing your sustainable growth is the key to consistency. Do not depend on will power. |Actionability is the key]].

1. **Make it obvious-visible**: [[5-2a2 What gets measured gets managed |what gets measured gets managed]]. Understand the context wherein your certain habit is triggered, and make that causation as clear as possible. It’s also the essence of [[1-1a2e4b Naval - 'Enlightenment is in between your thoughts, in understanding why you are having such thoughts' |enlightenment]] and [[9-4b2a1d0.3 The essence of analysis is articulation - 分析の本質は分節 |analysis]]. You need clear feedbacks. It’s easy to tell if you suck at riding a bicycle, but for swimming the water can dampen the feedback. You want to get rid of the water. 
2. **Make it attractive**: [[2-1a1a3c Belong where your desired habits are the norm |belong where your desired habits are the norm]]. Related mental models are [[2-1a6b 'Pavlovian association' & 'Social proof' - Understand the arbitrary association formed within your culture. There are no pure indexes for humans. |Pavlovian association and social proof]].
3. **Make it easy**: follow **[[9-4b3e3f The Two-Minute Rule - 'When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do' |the Two-Minute rule]]**. It's similar to how interface should follow [[9-4b3e3a Interfaces should follow the principle of least astonishment |the principle of least astonishment]]. [[2-1b2b1a Get your incentives right from the beginning |Get your incentives right from the beginning]].
4. **Make it satisfying**: *[[5-1b4c1c Align your short-term reward with your long-term vision |align your short-term reward with your long-term vision]]*. Use [[2-1b2c 'Compounding' - Permeate across the timeline |compounding]] to your advantage.

I have *stupid-decisions-I’ve-made folder* and all my stupid decisions are written down. But my girlfriend knew better. She said, *"What's the point of it? You just write them down—but not doing anything about it!"*

For example, when I pick tank tops for my pajama I wake up cold. I took note of that. And told her I will also put a note in the bedroom saying "*Don't go to bed with tank tops.*" But she told me to buy nice pajamas, and place them on the bed everyday. She knows better.

[[RUL3 - Ask 'what would it look like if it were easy and fun' |Ask ‘what would it look life if it were easy and fun?’]]—instead of figuring out how to be self-disciplined.
