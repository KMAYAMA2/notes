[[5-2c2 Fake stuff usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter]]
[[7-1a5c Engineers address the problem itself, and sales people help making that problem everyone’s problem NOW]]

[[9-1a1 People who converge upon the truth converge with each other]]
[[9-1b You can’t really transfer your knowledge to others, because each knowledge has to be created individually]]

Contradictory (somehow):
[[9-2 Everything is sales]]
