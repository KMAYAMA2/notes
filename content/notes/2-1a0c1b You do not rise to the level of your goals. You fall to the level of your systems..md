> “Set up systems, not goals.” – Scott Adams

You need both goals and systems
	[[1-1a5a1 The process of argument starts in the middle, and doesn’t start with axioms and end with the conclusion]]

[[5-1b4c Exponential growth feels flat in the beginning, precisely why it’s worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. You can also follow the Fun Criterion (the latter likely exhausts the former). Consistency is the key.]]
[[5-2b0 You are what you do repeatedly]]

[[5-2b1 Writing out your goals is how you become performance-oriented in life]]
[[5-2d2 You need somewhat grandiose goals to procrastinate structurally - テーマはひとつでは多すぎる]]
[[5-2d When you are purpose-goal-oriented, you'll be problem-project-oriented, because you will face problems in the process of achieving the former and will break them down into mini-problems]]
	***[[2-1a0c1c Purpose (and curiosity) beats for-profit]]***
		[[7-1a4a1 Wealth created ≠ the P&L of a business. Remember - you get what you measure.]]
			[[2-1a7a Curiosity (i.e., the Fun Criterion) leads you to wealth, because wealth is knowledge]]
