Unpredictability ≠ intractability
Classical unpredictability ≠ quantum unpredictability

[[1-2g2t6 The effect of interference on a history depends on what other histories are present (e.g., Mach-Zehnder interferometer)]]
	**[[9-4b2a1d A group of people who doesn't know who they are and where they came from won't make it to the moon or Mars]]**
		[[1-2g2s4 Everyday objects are partitioned into nearly autonomous histories with one instance-position-speed, but every atom in those objects is a multiversal object not partitioned (i.e., fungible)]]

On classical physics - *“In practice we are never able to measure the initial positions and velocities perfectly . . . planetary motions . . . are untypical classical systems . . . to predict what a typical classical system will do after only a moderate period, one would have to determine its initial state to an impossibly high precision”*
	[[1-2g2t3c The effect of knowledge creation is significant both within a history (distance-independent) and across the multiverse (convergence)]]
		[[9-1a1 People who converge upon the truth converge with each other]]

Deutsch: *“Intractability is in principle a greater impediment to universality than unpredictability could ever be.”*
	Intractability is most clearly manifested in quantum phenomena that are highly predictable
		It appeared as though no practical rendering is possible for environments that do show the effects of quantum interference. Feynman correctly drew the opposite conclusion!
