[[1-2g2d Knowledge is life. Life is knowledge.]]
[[9-4b3b1 Popper - 'We let our ideas die in our place' (another difference between memes vs genes)]]

[[9-4b2a1b Build the Idea Maze - Explain the history around an idea, and why yours is a good one. Virtually render the history of the evolution of that idea.]]
