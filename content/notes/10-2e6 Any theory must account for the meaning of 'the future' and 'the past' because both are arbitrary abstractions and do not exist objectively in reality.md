[[10-2e7 The common-sense concept of cause and effect makes sense because 'variants' do exist somewhere in the multiverse. Nothing necessitates causes to precede their effects.]] 

The common-sense concept of cause and effect makes sense only because _variants_ do exist in the multiverse. Not in the past or in the future, but they literally do exist somewhere in the multiverse. There is nothing in this definition of cause and effect that logically requires causes to precede their effects, and it could be that in very exotic situations, such as very close to the Big Bang or inside black holes, they do not.
