[[9-4b2b1 We are free because we can create knowledge, and knowledge is unpredictable]]
[[9-4b2c You can host multiple memes both consequentially or simultaneously during your lifetime. A gene in contrast can be hosted only once per life-cycle.]]

***Memes are subject to conscious variation*** (to be more precise, memes are to vary because two minds can never have the same problem-situation - we vary memes consciously but also unconsciously - or more precisely, we can't help varying those memes - this is what it means to have the ability to guess and create meanings) ***and selection, and can be rejected intentionally, whereas genes are random and can’t be rejected (“No Design Law”).***
[[10-2g3d1 Humans do stupid things because we can guess and create meanings. Other life-forms don't have that ability to create knowledge actively. Our ability comes with a great cost of potentially doing very (infinitely) stupid things.]]

**An individual can assume the role of universal explainer with memes, not with genes.**
