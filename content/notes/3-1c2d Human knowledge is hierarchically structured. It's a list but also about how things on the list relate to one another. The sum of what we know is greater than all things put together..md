With thick enough description, we can form representation of someone's value rankings and knowledge structures arbitrarily well. However, there will always be a *slip*. And this *slip* is inevitable for even concepts like 'the economy' and 'the supply chain'. But it's always (here literally) better than nothing. ([[1-2f1b3a Deutsch - 'Nor is a person capable of making progress merely by virtue of being willing to drop a theory when it is refuted; one must also be seeking a better explanation of the relevant phenomena. That is the scientific frame of mind.']])
