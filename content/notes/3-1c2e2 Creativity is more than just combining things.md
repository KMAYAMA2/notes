[[3-1c3c1 To create is to recombine. Innovation happens when ideas have sex (either between people or with one’s past ideas). Exchange is to technology as sex is to evolution.]]
	[[3-1c3d3 When problems are so well defined, your future self might be able to solve new problems by reusing and recombining them]]

[[10-2f1a We are making communication efficient not only combinatorically (syntax) but also semantically (by using context)]]

Explanations precede the decision of choosing what to combine!
	[[5-2b4 Explanation (explicit or inexplicit) precedes both your options and choices]]

Genetic combinatorics aren't truly random (digital) in comparison to our ability to create knowledge with explanations via symbols. Symbols are more universal than genetic code.

[[1-2f1b2 Composability allows incremental piecemeal error-correction]]
	Maybe creativity is about finding out the order of things (of which there are always things left unexplicit)
		[[3-1c2f In tech, most of the value is in the ordering, in the useful configuration of zeroes and ones, which users click to pay for it]]

**[[3-1c2e0 There is no minimum idea]]**
	Understanding is recursive ([[1-1a1a Our mind is not necessarily composed linearly or hierarchically. It could be a connected web of nodes and reflexive.]])
		Deduction is not the best topology to depict human understanding, as it were!
			[[1-1a4b0 Deduction can't generate knowledge.]]
				[[1-1a4 We don’t just take in ‘new things’ into our mind; at the same time, we recalibrate the framework with which such new inputs can be processed.]]

Remember how derivative markets are born. They are more than combining things. 
	Because [[5-1b1a2c0.1 Perfect replication is impossible]], and because we have the ability to detect differences as well as commonality, we always end up creating something new. #develop
