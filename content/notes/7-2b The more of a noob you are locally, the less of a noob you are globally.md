My favorite quote from Paul Graham. He also advices how we should [[7-2a Be opportunistic and flexible globally rather than inverting locally and prematurely optimized]].

He also makes a case for being a nerd because [[3-1c3c6 Nerds have an advantage in doing great work because they expend little effort on seeming anything]]. #develop 

This is similar to Charlie Munger's case for being a multidisciplinary thinker, because [[3-1a3 Multidisciplinary thinking is the most realistic thinking]]. In other words, we can [[3-1a0 Use categories, but don't be categorized]]! #categories
