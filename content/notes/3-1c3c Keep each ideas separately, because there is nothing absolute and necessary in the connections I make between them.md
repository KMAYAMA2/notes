[[3-1c3c1 To create is to recombine. Innovation happens when ideas have sex (either between people or with one’s past ideas). Exchange is to technology as sex is to evolution.]]

[[3-1c3c00 Evergreen notes should be atomic]]
[[3-1c3c0 Ideas have timing]]
[[3-1c3d Problems should be well defined and should be actionable]]
