> “Creativity means any idea can lead to any other thought” – [[Naval Ravikant]]

Store each ideas separately and take them seriously. If you bind two or more ideas together and store them as an idea, you lose the ability to play with them—the connection is arbitrary after all. This is one reason why I prefer [[3-1c3c00 Evergreen notes should be atomic |atomic evergreen notes]].

Keep each problems separately as well. [[3-1c3d Problems should be well defined and should be actionable |Problems should be well defined]] and should be actionable, because [[3-1c3d3 When problems are so well defined, your future self might be able to solve new problems by reusing and recombining them |your future self might be able to solve new problems by reusing or recombining them]].  Mini-projects are also [[3-1c3d0 Break down into mini-projects, they become more actionable because they are less scary than bigger ones |less scary]] than big ones.

But remember that [[3-1c2e0 There is no minimum idea |there is no minimum idea]]—you have to simplify the problem, but [[2-1a0a 'Occam's razor' & 'Irreducibility' - Simplify the problem but don't oversimplify. |don’t oversimplify]].
