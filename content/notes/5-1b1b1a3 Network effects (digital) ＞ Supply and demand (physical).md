Don’t use the supply-and-demand mental model everywhere. [[3-1c2e4.1 'Scarcity' - Knowledge is rare but never a scarce resource |Knowledge is rare but never a scarce resource]]. Help yourself and others at the same time with the knowledge you have—that’s [[Carlo Cipolla |the definition]] of intelligent person.

- **Network effects (digital) > Supply and demand (physical)**
	- "Skeptics sometimes suggest that NFTs will restrict the sharing of media. In fact, NFTs provide an incentive to loosen restrictions. Copying and remixing generally increase the value of NFTs, just as more players in video games increase the value of virtual goods. The same effect happens with physical art too. Both owner and artist can benefit from copying because, as the art is more widely shared, the original copies can grow in value. In the extreme case, a work of art, like the Mona Lisa, can become a widely reproduced cultural icon."

		- "People love video games, but people also love music, books, films, podcasts, and digital art. These other creative industries have simply experimented with fewer new business models. People make and listen to music as much as ever. The problem isn’t supply and demand; it’s the broken business models in between.”

A key challenge when building networks is overcoming the “bootstrap” or “cold start” problem: attracting users and contributors before enough of them are participating to make the network intrinsically useful.
- Network effects cut both ways: they can accelerate growth, but they can also handicap it. Scaled networks attract new users without much effort. Conversely, subscale networks struggle just to survive.
