[[10-2g2e9b DNA is digital system which evolves by discrete changes. If it were analog, evolution couldn’t have happened.]]
[[1-2g2s7b You can’t justify the predicted value of the probability inductively, because theory (i.e., the laws of physics) provides the probability, not the experiment]]
[[1-2g2s7a Knowing probability doesn't mean you can predict it]]

[[1-2g2c2 The principles of quantum physics dictates that speed and position (or definite path and definite path superposition) cannot be tested simultaneously]]
	[[1-2g2c3 Intractable does not mean unpredictable]]

There would be no need for a Turing test per se, if we had good explanation for how the program creates knowledge
	[[1-2f1b3 Merely dropping a theory because it doesn't work is behaviorism and is not error-correction. It's analog reasoning in disguise. You need explanation.]]
	To say that *"something is wrong"* requires explanations
		Remember: it’s easier to say *"this is wrong"* than *"this is right"*
			[[1-2f1b4 The content of a theory is in what it rules out (and how!)]]
		    [[1-2g2t3d Because creation (and growth) of knowledge is in essence error-correction, and because being wrong is way easier than being right, knowledge-creating-bearing entities will become more alike (and thrive) across the multiverse]]
		    [[5-1b1a1 Improving on already existent technology by removing one of its restraints amounts to innovation]]
