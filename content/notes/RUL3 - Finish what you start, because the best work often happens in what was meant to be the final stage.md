> *「継続すること ── リズムを断ち切らないこと。長期的な作業にとってはそれが重要だ。いったんリズムが設定されてしまえば、あとはなんとでもなる。しかし弾み車が一定の速度で確実に回り始めるまでは、継続についてどんなに気をつかっても気をつかいすぎることはない。」* – 村上春樹

**Related Notes:**
- *Iterate in the long-run*
	- **[[1-1a5b4.3 build-launch-measure-learn and iterate - don't restart]]** (this one explains why you should start, and what it means to finish what you start)
		- [[2-1b2 Play in different time horizon. That is, in the long-run.]]
			- [[2-1b2c 'Compounding' - Permeate across the timeline]]
				- [[6-3b2f Composability implies compounding]]
- *Make it easier to iterate*
	- [[9-4b3e3d リトライの操作を迅速にすること・させること]]
- *Use the Hemingway bridge method*
	- The quality of final reps for the day (e.g., running, skiing, batting, writing, drawing) determines the quality of your next day’s work   
		- [[3-1d6c Amara’s law modified - we underestimate the importance of consistency in the short-run, but overestimate in the long-run]]
			- [[9-4b3e3e 'Friction and viscosity' - Give THE problem as much attention as possible. Better UI-UX often can make innovation possible because users benefit from cognitive offload.]]
