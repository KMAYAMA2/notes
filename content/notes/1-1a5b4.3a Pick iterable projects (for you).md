Pick what you can iterate. Something simple. Don’t worry—your ability to iterate on more complex projects will get better. But you have to start somewhere.

[[7-1b4e What you can ＞ What you want (できること ＞ やりたいこと) |You can do it, if you do it]] (or, *you will be able to do it, if you do what you can do now*)

[[7-1b4f Let the tech decide where to go (both intellectually and physically)]]
	[[7-1b4b You can let the tech decide what are the problems to be solved. Otherwise, it will decide by itself. It's about possibility and not about should.]]
