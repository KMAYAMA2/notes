- E.g., 
	- Vitalik on permission: To implement change in Ethereum network you need permission from the community, and this gets especially harder for base layer (L1) as it got and gets bigger. It is not simply everything is under the hands of individuals with blockchain.
	- Naval on Layer3: Naval pointed out how much more innovative ideas and technologies are invented and implemented on Layer2 compared to base layer. He was also pointing out how incentives to create something on existent blockchain are much less than copy existent blockchain. #develop
