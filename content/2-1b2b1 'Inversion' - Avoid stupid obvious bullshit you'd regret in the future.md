- IN LIFE
	- ***"Wisdom is turning your future hindsight into your current foresight."***
	- *Seneca: “Let us prepare our minds as if we had come to the very end of life”*
	- *Steve Jobs: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?”*
	- *Jeff Bezos: "I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, “Okay, now I’m looking back on my life. I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have.” . . . I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried Amazon. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed I wouldn’t regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that that would haunt me every day, and so, when I thought about it that way it was an incredibly easy decision."

- IN PROFESSION
	- *"While the rest of us are chasing victory, the best in the world know they must avoid losing before they can win"*

*"Sometimes the cost of being wise is that other people treat you like a fool. And no wonder: fools can’t see what wise people do. Wise people see life in all its breadth: work, health, family, friends, faith, and community. They don’t fixate on one part to the exclusion of others. They instead know how to harmonize life’s various parts, and pursue each in proportion to the whole. They know that achieving harmony in that way is what makes life meaningful, admirable, and beautiful."*
