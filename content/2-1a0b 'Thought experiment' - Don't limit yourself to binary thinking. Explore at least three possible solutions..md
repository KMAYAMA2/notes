*Problem-solving novices try to reduce a decision to just two options because it creates the false sense that they’ve gotten to the problem’s essence. In reality, they’ve just stopped thinking. And you never want to stop thinking! Novices fail to see the complexities of a problem that are apparent to a master. Masters see the simplicity hiding in the complexity. As Frederic Maitland purportedly once wrote, “Simplicity is the end result of long, hard work, not the starting point."*

- [[5-2b4a You can either decide from existent options, or make a decision (literally in the sense of creation) by creating new explanation]]
- [[3-1a2 The problem itself doesn't care how it's solved. Everything should be structured around solving problems.]]
*Remember: Limiting ourselves to binary thinking before fully understanding a problem is a dangerous simplification that creates blind spots. False dualities prevent you from seeing alternative paths and other information that might change your mind. On the other hand, taking away one of two clear options forces you to reframe the problem and get unstuck.*
- **The bad outcome principle**: Don’t just imagine the ideal future outcome. Imagine the things that could go wrong and how you’ll overcome them if they do.
    - [[2-1a0c 'Denial' - Accept the existence of Black Swans]]
- **The 3+ principle**: Force yourself to explore at least three possible solutions to a problem. If you find yourself considering only two options, force yourself to find at least one more.
  - [[10-1c4 Think about your problem as a set of outcomes produced by a machine then customize, because thinking in terms of machine implies composability, and composable system is fixable]]
- **Safeguard**: Imagine that one of the options is off the table. Take each of the options you’re considering, and one at a time, ask yourself, “What would I do if that were not possible?"
