- Categories and concepts are somewhat subsidiary to purpose and problem they serve. Problem itself is also indicative of the framework (an explanatory world-view) from which it arises. However, because meaning is subject to misinterpretation (or because they can’t be interpreted uniformly), we can't construct/extrapolate the exact explanatory framework from the problem it created, just as we can’t fully explain categories and concepts others use even after evoking their explanatory framework with their problems and values. Each problem-situation can never be interpreted the same by different individuals (or even by the same individual at different times (am I the same? - Everett would likely argue that the sense doesn’t exist), and this makes uniform understanding impossible.
    - Problem itself is sign and has to be interpreted
    - In short, each individual has to come up with an explanation!
    - We can’t use anything as what it’s used by others.
        - We can’t have the same exact problem-situation, concepts, categories, purpose, and goals.
