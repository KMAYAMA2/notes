- [[1-1d Usually the obstacles are your own preconceived notions, and rarely the laws of physics]]
- [[3-1c3c2b Getting rid of your own misconceived notions alone can take you far enough]]

- [[1-2b In the quest for truth, what matters is the explanation and not where it came from, because even if gods reveal something to you it’s just as fallible as ever (the quest for truth ≠ a quest for certainty-justification-necessity)]]
- [[9-2a1 It doesn’t matter where you came from (or where you are); what matters is what you can do and where you are going]]
- [[3-1c2g Often times what matters is not what's used in the system, but what it does and can do]]

- [[5-1b1a2c1 Principles are meta-contingency. Whatever can happen can happen regardless of how.]]
- [[5-1b1a2c2 Constructor Theory is all about knowledge of how to correct errors (primarily of our parochiality-physicality) and thus optimism]]
- [[1-2g2s7b2 The laws of physics determine what's rare-common, probable-improbable, finite-infinite]]
- [[1-2g2p The laws of physics, by conforming to the Turing principle, make it physically possible for those same laws to become known to physical objects. Thus, the laws of physics may be said to mandate their own comprehensibility.]]
- [[10-2g2e1 Our best explanation invokes abstractions including causation and the laws of physics]]
- [[10-2g2e6b We exist in multiple versions, in universes called ‘moments’. Each version of us is not directly aware of the others, but has evidence of their existence because physical laws link the contents of different universes.]]

- [[2-3a1 Always ask - what does this even MEAN]]
- [[2-3b 'Leverage' - The effort put in and its utility-results doesn't have to correlate at all. Use this to your advantage.]]
