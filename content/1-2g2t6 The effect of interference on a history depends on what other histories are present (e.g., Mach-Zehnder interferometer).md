- From *ToKCast 23*
- Think of photons not as particles but as field (or probability) going through
- Phase shift occurs across the multiverse, and a history of a photon must invoke the other histories of the other photons
  - When that portion of photons go through the first silver-mirror, the distance it travels differ from those that reflect. This results in phase shift. If you change the distance between mirrors, or the thickness of them, you get different phase shift, that is, you can deterministically change which way the photon comes out (either 100% to the right, or 100% to the top, or anything in between, e.g., 75% to the right and 25% to the top).
- Universes differentiate then merge around that photon
