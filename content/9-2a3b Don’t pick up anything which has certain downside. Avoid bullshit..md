[[1-2f1 Popperian epistemology allows your knowledge to grow forever because it is digital. It can fix its errors by rejecting bad ideas]]

Contradictory (in the sense of *how can you decide one is better-worse than the others without an explanation?*):
[[New explanations are to be judged by how many more problems they solved and introduced. It has to be consistent with your web of ideas, or they have to solve more than introduced. You have to know your web of ideas.]]
[[Decision is about creating new options from the best explanation that you can form from the web of ideas you have]]
[[1-2f1b3a1 The question is not whether anomalies happened in the past, but whether we have explanations for such anomalies.]]

Counter-argument for contradictory sources:
