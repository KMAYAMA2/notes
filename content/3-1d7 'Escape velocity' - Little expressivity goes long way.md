- From *[[5-1b1a1c4 The interoperability laws (i.e., substrate-independent formulation of information) are more detailed exposition of the Turing principle]]*	(*Marletto p.206*): 
  - Classical information: *possibility* of 'flip' and 'copy' #develop 
  - Quantum information: *impossibility* (Heisenberg uncertainty principle) of copying certain information-carrying states and *possibility* of reversing any transformation #develop 
    - [[1-2g2t5a There is no such thing as the 'same' instance of a particle at different times - i.e., there is no such thing as speed of 'one instance' in the quantum physics (Heisenberg uncertainty principle)]]
      - [[1-2g2t5b The term 'uncertainty principle' is doubly misleading because first of all fungibility is a physical fact and not uncertainty of anything, and second of all because it can be derived from more general principle of quantum physics]]
    - Also assuming Reversible = Fungible:
