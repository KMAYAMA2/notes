- There are universal-digital symbols and parochial-analog symbols. Symbols in the form of inexplicit are analog (e.g., actions), whereas symbols in the form of explicit, particularly those expressed with universal writing systems, are digital. Culture invents parochial-analog symbols (i.e., anti-rational memes) first. Language becomes truly universal-digital *once it's been written*.

- Somewhat related (each discusses symbols and anti-rational memes, respectively):
- [[10-2f3a Learning human languages consists of constantly conjecturing-guessing the meaning of the words being used]]
- [[10-2g3d Behaviors can be replicators even when its meanings are not (properly) understood, because we can guess the meaning of memes. For rational memes, knowledge is THE replicator.]]

- Indexes are parochial-analog signs. Symbols are universal.
- [[10-2g2c Indexes are physical because they merely ‘indicate’ and hence do not require culture. Symbols are cultural. Put differently, indexes are analog and symbols digital.]]
