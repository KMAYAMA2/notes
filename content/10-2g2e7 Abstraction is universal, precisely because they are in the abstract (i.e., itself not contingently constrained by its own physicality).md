- But they have to be expressed with symbols. Symbols are arbitrary. But symbols are universal because of its arbitrariness, and it can represent anything including the abstract.

- But the representation can never be perfect. Or more precisely, we create abstractions insofar as abstractions contain knowledge. In other words, abstractions are creation via abductions at the edge of explicability.

**Abstracted means it can be expressed in arbitrarily many ways** (multi-modally, as it were).

- Because it can be expressed in arbitrarily many ways, it is best to build upon already existent better explanations, rather than building something from scratch.
