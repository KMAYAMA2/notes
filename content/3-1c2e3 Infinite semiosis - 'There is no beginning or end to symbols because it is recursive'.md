- **Peirce’s ‘infinite semiosis’** (HLB 4)
    - **[[3-1c2e5 Symbols are constructed of other symbols]]**
    - **[[3-1c2e4 There is no limit to the number of symbols available to humans for languages]]**
    - **There is no beginning or end to symbols, signs, *and ideas***
        - _Peirce anticipated both Levinson and Silverstein, however, in proposing that symbols are constructed of other symbols. In Peirce’s writings, the phrase ‘infinite semiosis’ means that there is no limit to the number of symbols available to humans for languages. This in turn is based on the view that signs are multifunctional. **Each sign determines an interpretant, but an interpretant is also a sign, so every sign embodies a second sign.** This is a kind of conceptual recursion, concepts within concepts, and represents a huge step forward in human communication. It means that a string of signs always contains other signs. According to Peirce, this can be understood when we see infinity even in a simple sequence like:_
            - _Sign1/Interpretant1 → Sign2/Interpretant2 … → Sign n_
	            - **[[10-1b4.1 Peirce - One needs 'interpretant' for language to get off the ground]]**
		            - Put differently, we always have yet-to-be-explicated-interpretant that precedes the current explicated interpretant

						- [[10-2c We can provide ever better explanations about ourselves]]
        - _This representation looks finite until we realise that Sign n cannot be the end because if it lacks an interpretant it is not a sign. Likewise, Sign1 cannot really be the beginning, because by definition it is connected to an interpretant of an earlier sign. So there is no beginning or end to symbols and signs. **The process that creates them is infinite because it is recursive.** Any random sign is always partially composed from another sign._
            - Is the implication of this is that, as long as you use symbols, that means you are using recursivity, even if your language doesn’t have recursive syntax?
