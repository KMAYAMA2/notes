*The point of packeting into mini projects is that it reminds you constantly of the problems you are working on, as well as the context (larger problem-situation) from which such problems (mini-projects) arise. It helps you solve the problem of what problems to solve at the same time.*
- [[3-1c1 Learning with intent to use them in the future (i.e., performance-output-oriented) filters down information, while constantly reminding you of the very problem-situation you are trying to solve and the very purpose that comes with it.]]
- [[5-2b1a1 Your goals are gateway to your problem-situation, just like your concepts and categories are to your purpose and values]]
